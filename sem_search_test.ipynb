       "' <baitd@qichigegexsmailtobeird @ichigangew> > wrote:\\nFrank:\\nWe have a situation in Flint, Michigan that is beginning to get national attention and could be an opportunity for Home Depot 18 months ago, Flint switched its water supply from Detroit Water (the distance and pumping costs of going uphill made it quite expensive) to the Flint River as a temporary answer; until they could finish the construction to get their water from Lake Huron (Karagondi Water System) . The corrosive attributes of the River water have exacerbated the lead deposit leaching into homeowner pipes and there is concern around lead poisoning; especially for infants.\\nThe corporate community is rallying to address the problem: Meijer donated 1500 water filters to low income residents and GM is about to announce a donation of between 5,000 and 10,000 filters Ido not yet know where GM is getting the filters from; but I was thinking that Home Depot might want to join the effort with a donation, supply chain discounting assistance, or some combination of activity that could help Flint residents   Harvey Hollins is our point person for this effort, Since he is the Director of Urban Initiatives for Governor Snyder. I have copied him here.\\nIf you could get this into the hands of the right people and see if there is interest in speaking with Harvey; I would be very appreciative. Thanks and take care.\\nRegards,\\nRich\\n'"
