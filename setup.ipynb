You may hear some grumbles about the pre-registration requirement for the Listening Session 12/2 at Mott This was based on logistical considerations availability, cost, safety and secure parking Also to give 40 people 2-3 minutes to speak will require 80-120 minutes time and this does not lend itself to an open town hall meeting format if we are going to effectively listen to and discuss with participants. Iwould suggest that we use funds to record and transcribe these session and a video of it be available on a website ,open to the public See below. We will need some help with hosting ,identifying speakers, bringing the microphone to them registration etc Would this be a role for MSU ? This group should make an effort to reflect the diversity of Flint. For_video recording consider Paul Herring SpectacleProductions, 405 University Blvd , Flint; cell 810-239-2901 office www spectacleproductions com If we have more registrants than space we can put them on the list for subsequent meetings which must occur in a timely manner. If we consider other sites, consider the requirements for public buildings in regard to open meetings It may be time to officially contact  Mayor Weaver about our plans and suggest to the Governor that we need an official representative to clarify our role and our intent to not conflict with the Mayor's public meetings Perhaps we need to be available to attend some of her meetings to listen also_ Finally, our electrical power was shut off for maintenance that had to be completed before freezing weather so phones and computers were down.

       "  \"Today was interviewed by Rebecca Thiele of public radio WKAR-Kalamazoo. The interview was prompted by the findings of Western Michigan University, Carla Koretsky, regarding the impact of road salt on a small deep kettle lake within the City of Kalamazoo We are funding a CMI monitoring grant for Dr. Koretsky to conduct additional assessment of several urban lakes and the associated watersheds. provided the reporter with the 2 attached reports and the link for a another report prepared by the USGS (bttp lLpubs_usgsgovlsi-/2011/52332): These reports all have sections devoted to chlorides and correlate high chloride concentrations in lakes and streams with urban land use. Questions-roughly & answers- briefly-no particular order 1_ From the 2007 NLA report, Mi lakes have higher conductivities and chloride concentrations than lakes nationally and within the upper Midwest ecoregion. Why? Speculated that compared to the rest of nation, particularly compared to the southern states, we have more sources including road salt: Compared to other states in the upper Midwest ecoregion we have more lakes in urbanized watersheds. 2 Will monitoring be conducted at other Kettle Lakes with urbanized watersheds to document the extent of the problem? Acknowledged that elevated chloride levels have been documented in urbanized areas of Michigan and concentrations in Woods Lake in Kalamazoo are problematic which is why we are funding additional work to document the extent of the problem and sources. We will routinely continue to monitor Michigan's resources for chlorides but the site specific nature of the problem precludes specific sampling for the issue. We do not have a Water Quality Standard for chloride but we have not identified toxicity issues where elevated concentrations have been found: 3 Will construction of roadside retention ditches solve the problem? Explained that best management practices for the typical NPS pollutants our agency addresses may not be appropriate for salt: made sure the reporter had a contact in MDOT.\\nAir date for the story is unknown:\\nMike Walterhouse, Environmental Quality Specialist Lake Michigan Unit Surface Water Assessment Section Water Resources Divvision, MDEQ 517-284-5548\\n2\"],\n",

       "  'For Immediate Release\\nEM Updates Council, Requests support for Emergency Loan and District Court Consolidation; Adjusts Salaries for Mayor and Council\\nFlint, Michigan S April 13,2015 ~ By letter to City Council issued today, Emergency Manager Jerry Ambrose congratulated City Council for their recent actions committing to restoring and maintaining the City\\' s financial solvency: Mr. Ambrose stated that recent actions to adopt a series of ordinances requiring commitment to establishing appropriate financial reserves and an improved planning and budgeting process indicate that the Council understands the need to restore and maintain Flint\\' s financial solvency. While there is much yet to do, these are positive steps in the right direction; said Mr. Ambrose. \" The ongoing challenge will be to adhere to the requirements the City Council has adopted themselves Mr. Ambrose \\' s letter also reiterated the priority issues currently facing the City - = developing a long range financial plan; beginning with the upcoming FY16 and FY17 budget; continuing to address concerns with water safety, quality and affordability; and stabilizing resources for public safety. (c These are clearly the top priority issues, and ones which require the cooperation of all if they are to be successfully addressed, stated Mr. Ambrose. \"Unfortunately, resources are extremely limited, and we must make decisions which address the most critical issues in a financially sound manner and that often means we cannot do everything everybody wants\\nSome of the ingredients of restoring Flint\\'$ financial solvency on a sustainable basis, according to Mr. Ambrose, include obtaining a S7 million loan to finance the accumulated General Fund deficit and approving the consolidation of the 67th and 68th District Courts. Both issues are pending before City Council and Mr. Ambrose is hopeful for & quick positive response. (( The terms and conditions offered with this loan equate to a good deal for the City and will enable it to begin to more quickly rebuild its financial solvency. Approving the court consolidation will reduce City expenses by $8.4 million over the next 10 years and will help to provide some stability in funding other public safety services Mr. Ambrose also presented Council with actions he is taking to continue the progress towards transition; including an updated purchasing ordinance and an order officially defining the role of the new City Administrator as the chief administrative officer for the City. iMoving the City forward in today\\' $ environment requires professional managers, clear responsibilities, and modern practices;= said Ambrose. (( These actions move in that direction, and hopefully move the Council forward in truly becoming the governing body of the City, focused on policies and accountability for moving the City forward based on its vision, mission, and goals.  Recognizing the increasing role of the Mayor and Council as the City transitions to home rule with oversight by a Receivership Transition Advisory Board, Mr. Ambrose announced that he is reestablishing the salaries for Mayor and Council at the levels in place before the City was most recently placed into state receivership. He noted that Council meetings are now held twice per month, with committee meetings held once per month, and the Mayor is now much more engaged in a Chief Executive role. Continued receipt of the re-established salaries, however, will be contingent upon attainment of certain training levels These training levels were established in prior orders of the Emergency Manager, and Councilmembers will have until November 1, 2015 to obtain it, or their salary will be reduced to the current level: ~END -Jason Lorenz Public Information Officer City of Flint (810) 237-2039 jlorenz@cityofflintcon<paito jorenz@cityoflintco\\n2'],\n",

Accordingly, to archive documents for the FWATF\\' s review and consideration, please e-mail to me (erothste@grg-ltdcom) or any one of the FWATF members and we will arrange for posting to Basecamp. If you have large documents or a large number of documents, please contact me and we can arrange for posting to Dropbox (This is why the project has not been accessible in the event that you have tried to load documents) thought it might be helpful for the FWATF to develop a brief status report on our activities interviews and meetings conducted and scheduled, documents collected, etc: perhaps on a bi-weekly or even weekly basis.  So, unless there is objection or concerns, will try to craft a reporting template for discussion by the FWATF at our next regularly scheduled meeting: If you have suggestions for this reporting, please send along: We have put on our respective calendars a weekly meeting, generously hosted at PSC offices, on Wednesday mornings We are also attempting to schedule a \"listening session\" in Flint in the next few weeks as well as briefing sessions with MDEQ and MHHS.\\nMy apologies for any confusion regarding the Basecamp set-up.

Sill no exact word on timing of blood lead level data from DHHS _ hopefully by late this week:\\nDEQ also has video that theyIl be using for some footage of the testing with TV stations  Link here: httpsLxgutubelAmyAcDWZRtA\\nFreeman Elementary water testing shows lead exposure limited to fixtures Experts release water testing results on schools and homes in Flint\\nAs part of Gov. Rick Snyder\\'s action plan for Flint drinking water; the DEQ today released water testing data from nearly 400 homes and businesses in Flint as well as comprehensive sampling results from Freeman Elementary School:\\nBoth sets of data indicate the problems with lead are localized to individual buildings or even individual faucets, rather than system-wide issues\\n\"The results from this data underline the need for water testing at all homes,; businesses, schools and other buildings in Flint; said George Krisztian, the DEQ\\'s Flint Action Plan Coordinator: \"Problems with lead exposure appear to be localized to individual service lines or plumbing fixtures, and we want to see all families in Flint take advantage of free water testing from the state.\\nFreeman Elementary testing results At Freeman Elementary , 31 faucets were tested using a series of four samples each: Twenty-two outlets did not show elevated lead exposure, but nine faucets came back with initially high results.\\nThose nine outlets involve brass components, indicating the problem involves the fixtures or plumbing immediately surrounding the fixture. When the faucets and fountains were operated for several minutes, lead levels fell significantly , in some cases to non-detectable levels.\\nAdditional testing designed to look deep into the school\\'s plumbing did not suggest larger; systemic issues\\nFreeman Elementary has several options for remedying the issues at these nine faucets and fountains. The school can elect not to use those particular fountains, or implement a formalized flushing regimen: The sampling results indicate that for all but one tap; a 3- to 4-minute flushing period each morning would drastically reduce lead exposure. For a permanent solution, the school should opt to replace the faucets and fountains of concern:\\n\"The safety and health of our students are our primary concern at Flint Community Schools, so we will start work as soon as possible to replace faucets, aerators and other related components where high lead levels were detected, FCS Superintendent Bilal Tawab said. \"Once those fixes have been made, the DEQ has offered to provide additional testing of the water at Freeman Elementary to ensure the water from every sample is safe for our students. Flint Community Schools appreciates the efforts by the DEQ, working with all stakeholders to make sure our water continues to be tested and that our students have access to safe , clean drinking water:\\'\\nFor Freeman Elementary\\'s complete sampling results and more information about how sampling was conducted, visit wwwmichigan qovilintwater:\\nThe DEQ and the DLARA also have conducted sampling at other Flint schools, and results will soon be available on the DEQ\\'s website. Additionally, the state will test every other school in the Flint Community Schools district, as well as any school or daycare in the city: Interested schools and daycare centers should contact George Krisztian at krisztiang@michigangov\\nHomeowner and other customer-requested testing results Results from the 381 samples from homes, businesses, schools and other facilities that took advantage of free water testing through the state showed similar; localized results. More than 75 percent of the samples analyzed demonstrated lead results of 5 parts per billion or less, and more than 91 percent demonstrated lead results of 15 parts per billion or less.\\nThis data suggests that while some homes experience elevated lead level results due to lead service lines or in-home plumbing; many other homes experience Iittle to no lead  This can make it difficult for homeowners and businesses to predict their lead exposure.\\n\"Since it\\'s not easy to predict if an individual home\\'s water is at risk for lead, the best thing all residents can do is get their water tested, Krisztian said. \"It\\'s a free test that provides valuable information for families\"\\nTesting is available for free by contacting the Flint Water Plant at 810-787-6537 and pressing 1, or by emailing flintwater@citvoiiintcom\\nFor more information about water samples received through the state\\'s free testing program, visit WW michigangovlilintwate::\\nHow school sampling was conducted To conduct this comprehensive sampling, the DEQ and Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs began on Oct  23 with a thorough plumbing assessment of the school to gain a comprehensive understanding of how water moves through the building and what types of plumbing materials are used. The assessment also identified 31 faucets or fountains in the school that provide water for drinking, cooking andlor food preparation:\\nOn Oct. 24, the DEQ and DLARA took four;, 125-milliliter samples from each of the 31 identified faucets and fountains. The first two samples were taken immediately after turning on the faucet; followed by a 30-second flush and then the third sample; followed by a 2-minute flush and then the fourth sample These samples provided information on the impact of any lead sources in or around each specific faucet and fountain as well as its connecting plumbing:\\nOn Oct. 31, the DEQ and DLARA took an additional 30 samples, 10 each from three sites in the school. These 1-liter samples were taken consecutively, and provided information about the impact of any lead sources deep in the building\\'s plumbing:\\n2 ',\n",

       "  \"asap\\napologize for the delay in responding more specifically to this assignment; it took some time to review our Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention program data to see if it might contribute to the understanding of the situation in Flint with their water supply. Here is what we found:\\nWe looked at lead testing results for May 2014-April 2015, which is the 12 month time frame just after Flint started drawing their water from the river (water source changed in April 2014).\\nWe compared lead testing rates and lead testing results to the same time frame for the previous 3 years, to see if there were any patterns that suggested that there were increased rates of lead poisoning after the water supply was switched: Per the attached charts\\nLead testing rates remained about the same from year to year (chart on the right): There was a spike in elevated blood lead tests from July-September 2014 (chart on the left, gold line): However that pattern was not terribly different from what we saw in the previous three years, especially in 2011-2012 (we are working with our Epidemiologist to statistically verify any significant differences): We commonly see a 'seasonal effect' with lead, related to people opening and closing windows more often in the summer, which disturbs old deteriorating paint on the windows, sills and sashes. Window fans frequently blow and spread the lead dust from the deteriorating paint to other parts of the room/house: We suspect that the summer data spike may be related to this effect. Ifthe home water supply lines and/or river water were contributing to elevated blood lead tests, we expected that the increased rates would extend beyond the summer; but they drop quite a bit from September to October, stayed low over the winter, and are just starting to tail up again in the spring of 2015.\\nSo upon review, we don't believe our data demonstrates an increase in lead poisoning rates that might be attributable to the change in water source for Flint. We recognize that lead exposure via the water is only a small piece of what may be happening for families in Flint; however; we hope the information is helpful:\\nNancy Peeler\\n\",\n",

However, it was still the right position for the long term benefit of the city and its future They of course have not been particularly helpful in finding solutions to the issues. will say that the Drain Commissioner has been a good partner and is working overtime on the problem:\\nThey can\\'t reconnect to DWSD even if they wanted to as they sold the connector line: And, especially with the new rate increases in Detroit, their citizens would be less able to pay than they already are: The water certainly has occasional less than savory aspects like color because of the apparently more corrosive aspects of the hard water coming from the river, but that has died down with the additional main filters. Taste and smell have been problems also and substantial money has been extended to work on those issues.\\nNow we have the anti everything group turning to the lead content which is a concern for everyone, but DEQ and DHHS and EPA can\\'t find evidence of a major change per Geralyn\\'s memo below: Of course, some of the Flint people respond by looking for someone to blame instead of working to reduce anxiety: We can\\'t tolerate increased lead levels in any event, but it\\'s really the city\\'s water system that needs to deal with it. We\\'re throwing as much assistance a5 possible at the lead problem as regardless of what the levels, explanations or proposed solutions, the residents and particularly the poor need help to deal with it:\\nIt seems that continuing to find funds to buy local residents home filters is really a viable option and Harvey and all are pursuing more assistance in that work: Almost all the experts\" I\\'ve talked to are convinced the problem is in the old lines leading to homes and short of a massive replacement CSO type bond that wouldn\\'t resolve the issue for a couple of vears, nature (temp reductions), filters and a final connect seem to be the best courses of action:\\nThe residents are caught in a swirl of misinformation and long term distrust of local government unlikely to be resolved:\\nSent from my iPhone\\nBegin forwarded message: ',\n",
       "  'Quick recap on the interactions this week from the MDHHS side on the Flint water issue:\\nToday the City of Flint issued the attached \"Lead Advisory\" for residents to be aware of lead levels in drinking water and issued suggestions from the Genesee County Health Department as to what residents could do to reduce risk. These include: flushing cold-water pipes by running water for approximately 5 minutes, ~using only water from the cold-water tap for drinking, cooking and making baby formula ~installing a water filter that is NSF-certified for lead removal:\\nWe worked with the Genesee County Health Department throughout the week to get them in a more pro-active mode to provide this guidance publicly and to encourage citizens to have the City test their water if they were concerned about the quality of water at their home: The health department also issued this fact sheet htelLwwwecgudesEoe \\'2geGCHpLeasnWatel_Ext_Sheet 2 L2df on Thursday providing additional information on the issue:\\nMDHHS epidemiologists continue to review the \"data\" provided by a Hurley hospital physician that showed an increase in lead activity following the change in water supply: While we continue to review this data, we have stated publicly that Hurley conducted their analysis in a much different way than we do at the department: Hurley used two partial years of data, MDHHS looked at five comprehensive vears and saw no increase outside the normal seasonal increases: The Hurley review was also a much smaller sample than MDHHS data as ours includes all hospital systems in Flint as well as outside laboratories.\\nWe have also provide the attached data chart that outlines if the elevated blood lead levels were being driven by a change in water, we would have seen the elevated levels remain high after the change in water source.\\nWe have also communicated that for WIC beneficiaries in Flint with documentation of unsanitary water, they may be able to receive ready to feed formula and have encouraged families to contact WIC to see if they are eligible for this formula: SNAP beneficiaries are able to purchase bottled water with their SNAP funds.\\nTalking points from MDHHS are attached as well.\\nThank VOU, G\\n2'],\n",

But the DEQ had approved the river as a backup source for emergency purposes in 2006. The treated water met safety standards in quarterly tests by the Flint WTP , but Flint had never tested its effect on the distribution system In an email review of key DEQ managers to determine if there was an effort to conceal information, only one email exchange raised red flags. The EPA had asked DEQ in February 2015 if Flint had a corrosion control program; the DEQ responded the city had an optimized program in place. But in April the EPA asked again, and the DEQ said that the Flint Water Treatment Plant (WTP) was not doing corrosion control. DEQ later explained that its first response referred to its program to monitor a new water source (in this case, the Flint river) for lead/copper for two consecutive six-month periods to determine optimal corrosion treatment: The report says there's no reason to believe that DEQ willfully misrepresented information to the EPA. It also concludes that ODWMA employees appeared to have notified management properly about the unfolding Flint water situation:\\nDEQ did not consult with the EPA on how best to apply the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) monitoring practices after the switch to Flint water, but from past experience, DEQ believed it was doing so correctly by doing two rounds of six-month monitoring on the new water source before determining optimal corrosion control. The EPA disagreed with DEQ's interpretation of the LCR, but later stated that the LCR was open to interpretation: It then clarified the rule; the upshot: corrosion controls already in place when Flint was on Detroit water should have been maintained after the switch:\\nDEQ should have notified the Flint WTP to start corrosion controls once the first round of six-month sampling results arrived in late March 2015 and showed the water exceeded acceptable lead levels:\\nDEQ doesn't oversee the Flint WTP so it doesn't have any accountability measures to ensure the WTP is collecting water samples from tier 1 homes, i.e-, residences with lead service lines, soldering or plumbing: Instead, DEQ relies on Flint's certification of sample sites. The auditor suggests DEQ should consider an independent verification of the sampling pool or Flint's certifications. In November 2015, Flint admitted that it had no way to ensure the sites were all tier 1 Water samples came from 175 randomly distributed testing bottles. DEQ has asked Flint to verify its prior samples by this Wednesday (12/30).\\nThere's been controversy that DEQ dropped two sampling sites with high lead levels from its second six-month review. It was appropriate for DEQ to do so because those sites did not meet federal criteria. It was also appropriate for DEQ to require flushing taps the night before sampling to ensure faucets didn't contain overly stagnant water.\\nCharts show that most water samples were taken in the sixth month of the six-month testing period: The report said it's tough to determine if the lateness of the sampling affects the accuracy:\\nThe report ends with an excellent timeline: have attached the report in case you want to review the timeline on page 11.\\nMeegan Holland Director of Communications for Gov.

I am livid _ VaTech\\'s analysis demonstrated that my home\\'s water supply has unacceptably high levels of lead.

Under the Detroit emergency manager , the Detroit water system threatened to raise our water rates to an unacceptable level. To save money your emergency manager decided to switch US to river water without implementing essential and required treatments, and your DEQ failed in its oversight responsibility to ensure that we have received the safe water that we have (dearly!) paid for. Instead, we\\'ve received (expensive) poison. And now Mr. Wyant dodges and weaves in response to Ms. Canty\\'s (rather excellent and well-researched) questions: He repeatedly said, in essence, \\'Well, there are experts who say all sorts of stuff\" and avoids answering her very clear yes/no questions. It is clear that his department demonstrated incompetence in regard to Flint\\'s water.

       "  'Importance: High\\nPlease see below and attached release per brief convo at senior staff. Sill no exact word on timing of blood lead level data from DHHS _ hopefully by late this week:\\nDEQ also has video that theyIl be using for some footage of the testing with TV stations. Link here: https ILxoutubelAmyAcDWZRtA\\nFreeman Elementary water testing shows lead exposure limited to fixtures Experts release water testing results on schools and homes in Flint\\nAs part of Gov. Rick Snyder\\'s action plan for Flint drinking water; the DEQ today released water testing data from nearly 400 homes and businesses in Flint as well as comprehensive sampling results from Freeman Elementary School. Both sets of data indicate the problems with lead are localized to individual buildings or even individual faucets, rather than system-wide issues\\n\"The results from this data underline the need for water testing at all homes; businesses, schools and other buildings in Flint; said George Krisztian, the DEQ\\'s Flint Action Plan Coordinator: \"Problems with lead exposure appear to be localized to individual service lines or plumbing fixtures, and we want to see all families in Flint take advantage of free water testing from the state.\\nFreeman Elementary testing results At Freeman Elementary, 31 faucets were tested using a series of four samples each: Twenty-two outlets did not show elevated lead exposure, but nine faucets came back with initially high results.\\nThose nine outlets involve brass components, indicating the problem involves the fixtures or plumbing immediately surrounding the fixture. When the faucets and fountains were operated for several minutes, lead levels fell significantly, in some cases t non-detectable levels.\\nAdditional testing designed to look deep into the school\\'s plumbing did not suggest larger, systemic issues\\nFreeman Elementary has several options for remedying the issues at these nine faucets and fountains. The school can elect not to use those particular fountains, or implement a formalized flushing regimen. The sampling results indicate that for all but one tap; a 3- to 4-minute flushing period each morning would drastically reduce lead exposure.\\nFor a permanent solution, the school should opt to replace the faucets and fountains of concern:\\n\"The safety and health of our students are our primary concern at Flint Community Schools, so we will start work as soon as possible to replace faucets, aerators and other related components where high lead levels were detected, FCS Superintendent Bilal Tawab said. \"Once those fixes have been made, the DEQ has offered to provide additional testing of the water at Freeman Elementary to ensure the water from every sample is safe for our students. Flint Community Schools appreciates the efforts by the DEQ, working with all stakeholders to make sure our water continues to be tested and that our students have access to safe, clean drinking water:\\'\\nFor Freeman Elementary\\'s complete sampling results and more information about how sampling was conducted, visit w michigan govlilntwatec:\\nThe DEQ and the DLARA also have conducted sampling at other Flint schools, and results will soon be available on the DEQ\\'s website. Additionally , the state will test every other school in the Flint Community Schools district; as well as any school or daycare in the city. Interested schools and daycare centers should contact George Krisztian at krisztiang@michigangQv:\\nHomeowner and other customer-requested testing results Results from the 381 samples from homes, businesses, schools and other facilities that took advantage of free water testing through the state showed similar; localized results. More than 75 percent of the samples analyzed demonstrated lead results of 5 parts per billion or less, and more than 91 percent demonstrated lead results of 15 parts per billion or less.\\nThis data suggests that while some homes experience elevated lead level results due to lead service lines or in-home plumbing, many other homes experience little to no lead. This can make it difficult for homeowners and businesses to predict their lead exposure.\\n\"Since it\\'s not easy to predict if an individual home\\'s water is at risk for lead, the best thing all residents can do is get their water tested, Krisztian said  \"It\\'s a free test that provides valuable information for families \\n2 Testing is available for free by contacting the Flint Water Plant at 810-787-6537 and pressing 1, or by emailing flintwater@cityofflint con\\nFor more information about water samples received through the state\\'s free testing program, visit www michiqan sovlilniwatec:\\nHow school sampling was conducted To conduct this comprehensive sampling, the DEQ and Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs began on Oct: 23 with a thorough plumbing assessment of the school to gain a comprehensive understanding of how water moves through the building and what types of plumbing materials are used. The assessment also identified 31 faucets or fountains in the school that provide water for drinking, cooking andlor food preparation:\\nOn Oct: 24, the DEQ and DLARA took four; 125-milliliter samples from each of the 31 identified faucets and fountains. The first two samples were taken immediately after turning on the faucet; followed by a 30-second flush and then the third sample, followed by a 2-minute flush and then the fourth sample. These samples provided information on the impact of any lead sources in or around each specific faucet and fountain as well as its connecting plumbing:\\nOn Oct. 31, the DEQ and DLARA took an additional 30 samples, 10 each from three sites in the school: These 1-liter samples were taken consecutively, and provided information about the impact of any lead sources deep in the building\\'s plumbing:\\n',\n",

In an effort to not politicize this situation, I have been working directly with state and local officials in seeking important information and attempting to correct the City $ water crisis. Unfortunately, I have been faced with continual road blocks in my requests for information. It has been nearly a month since I submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the State and the City of Flint requesting to see documents related to the City' $ switch to using water from the Flint River: I requested the applications and permits required by law to change a city' $ source of water. So far; the State Treasury has violated FOIA by not providing any information OT even a denial. The Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and City of Flint have denied my request saying that the documents I requested do not exist. However, state law requires Michigan cities to apply for a permit from the DEQ to switch their source of water. Violation of this law is punishable by a fine of S5,000 per day and possible incarceration. I find it hard to believe that the DEQ and the City of Flint ignored such a critical step, not to mention one that the cost in fines alone would already be roughly $2.5 million and cause those responsible to be subject to criminal prosecution:\\n~My request for these documents was meant to be a fact-finding mission to ascertain the degree to which the State knew about o took any action to determine the potential hazards of making this switch prior to being officially ordered by the State-appointed Emergency Manager. Since the State has decided not to disclose this information to me, it is unclear the extent to which the State is culpable. I believe the bottom line here is that the decision to switch the source of Flint' $ water to the Flint River was made by the Emergency Manager appointed by Governor Snyder and the burden is on his shoulders to make this right.\\n(c The use of the river water has caused a great amount of destruction to the City' $ water infrastructure, and it has put the residents who use the water in harm' $ way. To help continue this fight for information; I have retained attorney Keith D. Flynn of the law firm Miller Cohen PL.C. to further evaluate my legal options My position and recommendation to the Governor o this issue is that the State should immediately switch Flint s water source back to the Detroit Water System at no additional cost to Flint residents and supply water filters to every household in Flint.\\n~Furthermore, the State should begin to estimate costs for the total damage done to the City' $ public works infrastructure and for the treatment of potential adverse health outcomes we could see in Flint residents in the future and allocate expenditures to correct this problem\\nRosie Jones Deputy Press Secretary Michigan House Democrats O: 517.373.3731\\nbousedemscom\\n2 The information contained in this communication is intended for the use of the designated recipients named above.

The vote, approved 7-1 at the Flint City Council meeting Monday, March 25, may have set in motion the end to Flint paying to get its water from Detroit. Under the proposal, Flint would get 16 million gallons per day of raw water from Lake Huron, pipe it to Flint for treatment and then sell it to customers throughout the city. Another 2 million gallons per day would come from the Flint River and will be treated in Flint. Mayor Dayne Walling said the Department of Environmental Quality must approve Flint S getting 2 million gallons per day from the Flint River. Tuesday\\' $ meeting followed weeks of discussions and special meetings surrounding the resolution. Lc\" We got there, Councilman Joshua Freeman said. That\\' $ the important thing: There were more than 50 people at Monday\\' s meeting: (Going with Karegnondi is the best decision. We have no opinion on the economics of the decision: said Rebecca Fedewa, Flint River Watershed Coalition executive director.  If we start drawing water out of the Flint River; we are at risk of having to start releasing water from OUT reservoirs. Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright said the decision must still be approved by a county water and waste advisory board. The KWA board will then be reconvened for final approval. Wright said construction could start in May. State treasury officials still must approve the city council\\'s move because Flint has an emergency financial manager. All expenditures over $50,000 must be approved. Genesee County Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright has said that Flint would pay roughly $6.4 million annually for water service if it joined the pipeline a nearly S4 million savings on what it pays Detroit for water. Walling previously said the city would save $19 million over eight years by getting water from the KWA (It\\'s a historic night in the City of Flint;\" Walling said. (( The savings will be less with the capacity level approved by city council because there will be increased treatment cost for the river water. He said the DEQ told the city it needed to get 18 million gallons per day or there would have to be additional work done at Flint S water plant. Flint\\' $ water plant and the Flint River is currently the backup for Flint and Genesee County, however, the plant only operates four times per year. Councilman Bryant Nolden was the lone dissenting vote. cIt was a protest vote; Nolden said.   knew they had enough votes. Ijust feel like the Flint River is our best option  Karengnondi is the regional water authority that includes Genesee, Lapeer and Sanilac counties and the cities of Flint and Lapeer. Flint is the second municipality, behind Genesee County, to officially decide to purchase raw water through the KWA. Lapeer city officials said they intend to purchase water, but an agreement has been finalized. Dominic Adams is a reporter for MLive-Flint Journal. Contact him at dadamsS@@mlivecom or 810-241-8803.

The DEQ Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance has been given authority for oversight of these regulations. DEQ regulatory oversight is mainly conducted through inspections, review of monitoring information (this includes sample results and operations data), issuance of construction permits for water systems, and planning (reliability, emergency response, capital improvement, operation and maintenance, etc ) As both community water systems and the DEQ desire the mutual goal of safe water, the DEQ works proactively in partnership with water systems to provide compliance assistance. This also includes activities such as source water protection and infrastructure funding:\\n2 What is the DEQs response to the mayors request for assistance?\\nAs indicated by phone this letter was directed to the Governors Office and should be followed up with that office for response at this point in time:\\n3. What on-going testing is DEQ doing with Flint water and how often?\\nThe City is required to follow all state and federal monitoring requirements under Act 399. This includes sample analysis of over 90 contaminants with health based drinking water standards along with monitoring of its source, treatment, and distribution operations.  Sample analysis frequency is based on the specific contaminant type, its level of detection if any, and its potential variability.\\nIn regards to total coliform and e.coli bacteria compliance monitoring, the City is required to analyze at least 100 samples each monthly compliance period from its distribution system.\\nIn regards to Total Trihalomethane (TTHM) compliance monitoring, the City is required to collect quarterly samples from & locations in its distribution system: The TTHM standard is based on a Running Annual Average for each of the 8 locations, rather than individual sample results The location and timing of these samples is based on worst case conditions in the water system to identify the highest level of long term exposure\\n4_ So far, how many drinking water violations have occurred in Flint since the switch to Flint River water and what sanctions if any does the city face?\\nThe City has had the following Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) standard violations: E.Coli Acute bacteria MCL violation, August 2014 Total Coliform bacteria MCL violation, September 2014 TTHM locational running annual average MCL violation, October-December quarter (2 of 8 sites)\\nThere are generally two requirements in regards to the violations: Public Notification &nd corrective action Public Notice for acute health threats like the e.coli MCL must be made within 24 hours of the violation Public Notice for non-acute health threats such as total coliform bacteria and TTHM must be made within 30 days of the violation\\nCorrective action regarding bacteria detections generally involves taking steps to disinfect and repair the affected areas and sampling to obtain confirmation the bacteria source is has been addressed. The City has remained in compliance with this standard for each of the monthly monitoring periods since September, including thus far in January\\nCorrective action for TTHM involves taking steps to reduce the amount of TTHM so that they are below the standard. The City is required to complete an Operational Evaluation report within 90 days of the violation: This report includes examination of treatment and distribution operational practices (source water quality, treatment changes, storage tank operations, excess storage capacity, distribution system flushing, treatment problems that contribute to TTHM formation. The City proactively completed an Operational Evaluation following sample results from August 2014,and is now completing another operational evaluation further evaluated based on information from the November monitoring: November monitoring showed individual sample results now below the standard at 7 of 8 locations. However; as noted compliance is determined based on a running annual average at each location:\\n5 . What does DEQ tell Flint residents who call DEQ with concerns about discolored water?\\nCallers indicating discoloration or other aesthetic water quality issues are directed to contact the Flint DPW to allow the DPW staff to investigate the situation: Generally color, odor and taste are aesthetic water quality issues not related to any health based standards including total coliform bacteria, e.coli bacteria, and TTHM:\\nTreated water is monitored for color at the Water Treatment Plant as part of its operation, and has not been abnormal: The City of Flint has over 500 miles of distribution piping and conditions in some isolated sections of water main piping or private premise plumbing may cause changes to aesthetic conditions such as color; taste, or odor.\\nThose are my major questions. Could you please give me a call today?\\nChastity Pratt Dawsey Reporter Bridge Magazinef The Center for Michigan 28 W. Adams Suite 330, Detroit; MI 48226 WWW bridgemicom C: 313-310-7867\"],\n",

The two consequent monitoring results from December 2014 and June 2015 while meeting the action level were deemed optimal and were in fact increasing: As such the State sent s letter in August to require further optimization: We understand the City is going to use orthophosphate to fully optimize its system and that will happen this month:\\nWas the MDEQ unaware that there were aging lead service lines in Flint, and that those would increase the lead risk?

It was the City\\'s decision to use lime as its first treatment option and to monitor to see its effectiveness In some communities this treatment has been effective corrosion control.

Annual average results show all locations are within acceptable limits for total trihalomethanes (TTHM) and work continues to ensure that the average stays below the acceptable level. Flint s TTHM levels have now been below the actionable level for four consecutive quarters, long enough to bring the City out of violation with the Safe Water Drinking Act: Installation of the Granulated Activated Carbon filter mediums in July has had & significant impact on the reduction of total organic carbon (TOC) and is expected to continue to do s. TOC contact with chlorine can lead to the creation of the chemical byproduct trihalomethanes By reducing the amount of TOC in the treated water, the amount of TTHM in the water fell as a direct result.\\n~The City of Flint is continuing to improve its water system including both the areas of treatment and distribution; said Mayor Dayne Walling: 46 As the issue of trihalomethanes comes under control and the City is no longer in violation of safety standards, it will work with the MDEQ on implementing water optimization measures to reduce the corrosive effects of water on older pipes and home service lines: Older pipes and service lines can contain lead solder which can leach into the water over time.\\nFlint has been looking at the water optimization option for some time ad is now looking at taking accelerated steps toward implementation According to the MDEQ, & typical water optimization plan can take up to five years to complete, as in the case of the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department The City of Flint plans to bave its water optimization measures in place by the beginning of 2016. This measure, combined with the ongoing improvements to the distribution system wherever possible, will improve water quality and extend the perforance of the City' $ aging infrastructure.\\nsThe City of Flint has been in constant communication with the MDEQ in our continuing efforts to upgrade and improve our water system; 57 said Director of Public Works Howard Croft. <We have Teceived assurances from them that every step we have taken has been in line with their recommended actions  The City will continue to work to ensure safe, quality water to its residents, businesses and visitors. 73\\nThe City of Flint will continue to provide updates on its water progress through its website; cityofflintcom: Anyone with water issues is encouraged to call 810-766-7202 s0 that they can be addressed Residents wishing to receive a free and independent in-home water test can call 810 787-6537 or email flintwater@cityofflintcom\\n-END\\n~Jason Lorenz Public Information Officer City of Flint (810-237-2039 (Office) (Cell) jorenz@cityofflint_com\"],\n",

As these are mechanical devices the failure rates are very high when tested this infrequently with failure including air inlet valves stuck closed, leaky check valves or complete removal of the assembly: This is the equivalent of direct cross connections: The hydraulics of the plumbing system are the same for residential and commercial systems yet they will be treated differently if these bills are signed into law.\\nThe State House Regulatory Reform Committee ignored DEQ recommendations a5 well as recommendations from other industry professionals and passed a bill with testing not more often than once every 10 years: The State Senate decided to revise the billto testing not more often than once every 5 years without allowing public comment through the Senate Regulatory Reform Committee. This is politics at play with no regard for the safety of the drinking water.\\nOur only hope now is through contacting Governor Snyder and urging him to veto these bills.

Late last month, the state and the city both denied Phelps\\' request, saying that no such documents exist, In March and April of 2014, officials from both the city and state were also quoted in several articles on Mlive.com, making comments about the permit application process for Flint to switch its source of drinking water from Detroit\\'s system to the Flint River. \"Iwant to know what these officials knew about the safety and quality ofthe river water before the switch was made. Judging by their response and recent actions, it almost seems they knew a lot more than they are letting on to; D} Phelps said. \"Flint residents deserve better than this, they deserve to know the truth about the decisions that were made, and If have to\\nfight this in court to get the truth, so be It\\' \"\\n###\\nRosie Jones Deputy Press Secretary Michigan House Democrats O: 517.373.3731\\nhousedemscom Wurfel_Brad (DEQ)\\n',\n",

       "  \"Cc:\\nDraft response added some health and safety comments to the prior version)\\nIam providing my the comments below based on my memory of events that transpired over two years ago_ 1 have not reviewed the reports, emails, memos relating to these events and my recollections would likely change after refreshing my memory with the relevant documents.\\nFirst, it is important to understand Flint's decision to join the KWA was a separate and distinct decision from using the Flint River: After we signed off on Flint joining the KWA, Flint was to negotiate with the DWSD regarding using their water during the construction of the KWA. If they - were unable to negotiate a fair deal, I recall their back up plan was to use the Flint River. I don't recall Treasury being involved in the negotiations with DWSD o being advised that the negotiations broke down and Flint switched to the Flint River_ I don't recall any discussions that suggested there would be a safety risk associated with the decision to join the KWA Again, because using the Flint River was not before Treasury whether there were health and safety issues associated with that decision was not before Treasury.\\nTreasury held two and possibly three lengthy meetings to go over the Tucker Young report with the DEQ: The DEQ didn't agree with TY's report and identified several flaws in their assumptions which TY was unable to refute. The reason for the multiple meetings was to make sure our siding with the DEQ over TY was the correct decision. The reports were dependent upon engineering/construction related issues which were not the forte of Treasury so we relied on the advice and counsel of both TY and DEQ where the appropriate expertise resided to assist US in making this decision:\\nTY's largest customer was the DWSD and DWSD did not like the KWA project We didn't assume that factored into the TY findings but it was 0n our radar. We didn't believe the DEQ had any agenda so their conclusion together with TY's reliance on some flawed assumptions, led us to side wl the DEQs opinion. The flawed assumptions related as best I can recall on redundancy requirements that TY assumed the DEQ would demand which the DEQ said would not be required Once eliminated, the TY reports findings were undermined Irecall Treasury needed to approve the EM's decision to join the KWA (again not to approve Flint using the Flint River) . Irecall we were getting a lot of pressure from County and City - officials to approve Flint joining the KWA The decision had a deadline because whether Flint joined the project affected the size of the pipe that would bring in the water and the KWA needed to know if Flint would participate to purchase the correct pipe size.\\nIrecall advising the Governor's office of these events because my initial instincts were not to authorize Flint joining the KWA for two reasons: 1) Flint was not in a financial position to assume any financial risk re: the project; and 2) Detroit was also in financial distress and [ didn't think DWSD losing approximately 5% of their revenues was a good thing for them_\\nBecause I thought Treasury would go against local sentiment that heavily favored KWA, I thought the Governors office should be aware of the potential political fallout:\\nIalso wanted the Governor's office involved because I didn't think Treasury had the expertise to make this decision and as such we would need help from the DEQ and I wanted them to support the collaboration between the two departments. Inever received any pressure from the Governor's office to decide one way or the other on approving the KWA We followed the process described above and made a decision based upon what we thought was in the best interests of Flint: The decision to support KWA was influenced by the absence of any health and safety risks raised by our advisors and our conclusion that there was no financial risk to Flint for the project and the DEQs conclusion that it was more economical for Flint to join KWA (again a separate and distinct decision from using the Flint River). The fact this outcome was what the local officials wanted was a bonus from Treasury's perspective.\\nIdon't recall specific conversations on the dates and times You referenced  Ido know there were many discussions regarding this topic between Treasury, DEQ and the Governor's office and the facts and circumstances re: KWA led to a clear consensus there was no articulated reason to block Flint's desire to join the KWA\\nAndy Dillon Conway MacKenzie Inc 401 $.

A public health friend of mine said that Genesee County Health workers are stressed to the max Can we deploy appropriate personnel from other county health agencies to help with inspecting homes for possible other causes? In other words, it won\\'t do any good to invest more in water infrastructure if we\\'re finding window sills with teeth marks.  say this NOT to downplay the role that water lead levels may have played. But can we get Habitat for Humanity, for example, to do a massive volunteer effort to eradicate lead paint in homes or is that beyond their expertise? Gather experts to assess exactly how extensive the problem is and potential causes. And then convey this in a much more accessible ways. If you want blood level data, you have to scroll down on the DHHS web site, find the headline and then read a long press release: Maybe we\\'re conveying this information better on the ground, but if not, we need to communicate conclusive findings in multiple ways_ graphics, video, informational photo galleries and maybe even a \"test\" that residents can take to see if their home is at risk in other ways. know that sounds awfully MLive-ish, but it can be effective:\\n',\n",

       "  'Team,\\nPlease review this draft press release for the Thursday announcement in Flint: This incorporates some suggested edits to the strong draft from DEQ earlier today:\\nThank you very much:\\nGov. Rick Snyder: Move back to Detroit water provides best protection for public health in Flint State, Mott Foundation and city form partnership to fund switch FLINT , Mich: L Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great Lakes Water Authority as the source of the city\\'s drinking water, Gov. Rick Snyder said.\\nSnyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide a portion of the $12 million needed to reconnect with the authority, with the Flint city government providing $2 million and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation donating $4 million:\\nThe Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Environmental Quality today also committed an additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing through the state laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring for lead in drinking water:\\nFlint city leaders requested the state\\'s help to fund the reconnection after a Wednesday meeting of Flint\\'s Technical Advisory Committee. Flint\\'s move to the Great Lakes Water Authority is expected to cost about $1.3 million per month until the Karegnondi Water Authority is completed next summer:\\n\"AII Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water;\" Snyder said: \"The technical experts helping the city on its water advisory all agree this move back to the Great Lakes Water Authority provides the best public health protection for children and families. This effort today is the result of people coming together to solve a problem. appreciate Detroit\\'s willingness to reconnect with Flint; the Mott Foundation\\'s generous donation, and the dedication of all parties to come together to protect Flint families and children.\\'\\nThe move to Detroit water; which is drawn from Lake Huron, carries many public health benefits. As large bodies of water; the Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems from large rain events and other runoff issues that can be present in shallower rivers. Additionally , the Great Lakes Water Authority has already fully optimized its corrosion control, using phosphates to help coat the insides of pipes and prevent lead from leaching into the water.\\nHowever, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve the city\\'s problem with lead service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control: Additionally, some households in the city could experience lead in their drinking water until all lead pipes and plumbing are replaced.\\nTo best protect public health, Snyder said state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined on Oct: 2 in a comprehensive action plan; including continued testing; the use of faucet filters and providing residents with accurate information about steps to eliminate lead in water:\\nFree filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road MDHHS office locations.\\nFor residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs, free filters are available at the Genesee County Community Action Resource Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in\\n2 Flint: Staff will be at all four locations from 9 a.m to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and assist residents who have questions about proper installation: At the Lippincott location only, extended hours will be offered this weekend, including until 7 p.m. on Thursday and Friday and from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday:\\nOther good practices for residents concerned about lead include turning on the cold water tap and running the water until it\\'s as cold as it will go. Additionally, only use cold water for cooking, drinking and especially mixing baby formula.\\nSchool test results released; more investigation planned\\nThe state today also released the first results from its lead screening program in schools and homes. Of 37 total samples taken at 13 buildings; four samples spread over three buildings exceeded the federal action level of 15 parts per billion:\\nHowever; this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is committing to further testing water and inspecting plumbing at these schools. Until testing is complete, schools are advised to continue using bottled water and filtration as a precaution to protect children:\\nIn addition; free testing is still available for any other Flint school, including daycares and Head Starts. Free testing is also available for any Flint resident \\nAdditional information; including more detailed lead screening results, is available at wnichigan qoviilintwater ###\\nDave Murray Deputy Press Secretary Executive Office of Governor Rick Snyder MuevDl@michigerzov 517-335-6397, office\\nTwitter: @michigandmurray\\n3'],\n",

Rick Snyder: Move back to Detroit water provides best protection for public health in Flint State, Mott Foundation and city form partnership to fund switch FLINT, Mich: L Flint families and children will be better protected by reconnecting with the Great Lakes Water Authority as the source of the city\\'s drinking water, Gov. Rick Snyder said.\\nSnyder said Thursday that he will request the state Legislature to provide a portion of the $12 million needed to reconnect with the authority, with the Flint city government providing $2 million and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation donating $4 million:\\nThe Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Environmental Quality today also committed an additional $3.5 million for water filters, free lead testing through the state laboratory for Flint water customers, and hiring additional staff to conduct health exposure monitoring for lead in drinking water:\\nFlint city leaders requested the state\\'s help to fund the reconnection after a Wednesday meeting of Flint\\'s Technical Advisory Committee. Flint\\' s move to the Great Lakes Water Authority is expected to cost about $1.3 million per month until the Karegnondi Water Authority is completed next summer.\\n\"AIl Flint residents need clean, safe drinking water;\" Snyder said  \"The technical experts helping the city on its water advisory all agree this move back to the Great Lakes Water Authority provides the best public health protection for children and families. This effort today is the result of people coming together to solve a problem: appreciate Detroit\\'s willingness to reconnect with Flint; the Mott Foundation\\'s generous donation, and the dedication of all parties to come together to protect Flint families and children:\\'\\nThe move to Detroit water; which is drawn from Lake Huron; carries many public health benefits. As large bodies of water, the Great Lakes are naturally prone to fewer problems from large rain events and other runoff issues that can be present in shallower rivers. Additionally , the Great Lakes Water Authority has already fully optimized its corrosion control, using phosphates to help coat the insides of pipes and prevent lead from leaching into the water:\\nHowever, reconnecting with the authority will not completely resolve the city\\'s problem with lead service lines or aging infrastructure. It will take time for pipes in Flint to become coated with the phosphate corrosion control. Additionally, some households in the city could experience lead in their drinking water until all lead pipes and plumbing are replaced.\\nTo best protect public health; Snyder said state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined on Oct: 2 in a comprehensive action plan, including continued testing, the use of faucet filters and providing residents with accurate information about steps to eliminate lead in water.\\n2 Free filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St. or 4809 Clio Road MDHHS office locations.\\nFor residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs, free filters are available at the Genesee County Community Action Resource Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint: Staff will be at all four locations from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. \" Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and assist residents who have questions about proper installation.\\nAt the Lippincott location only, extended hours will be offered this weekend, including until 7 p.m on Thursday and Friday and from 10 a.m: to 2 p.m on Saturday:\\nOther good practices for residents concerned about lead include turning on the cold water tap and running the water until it\\'s as cold as it will go. Additionally, only use cold water for cooking; drinking and especially mixing baby formula School test results released; more investigation planned\\nThe state today also released the first results from its lead screening program in schools and homes. Of 37 total samples taken at 13 buildings; four samples spread over three buildings exceeded the federal action level of 15 parts per billion:\\nHowever; this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is committing to further testing water and inspecting plumbing at these schools. Until testing is complete , schools are advised to continue using bottled water and filtration as a precaution to protect children: In addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, including daycares and Head Starts Free testing is also available for any Flint resident:\\nAdditional information; including more detailed lead screening results, is available at mmichigan q2vmntater ###\\nDave Murray Deputy Press Secretary Executive Office of Governor Rick Snyder MurraxPl@richiganGOv 517-335-6397, office mobile Twitter:@michigandmurray\\n3'],\n",

Earley was in charge when the decision was made to switch the city to unsafe drinking water. If poisoning children wasn\\'t bad enough, after Earley failed the citizens of Flint; the governor inexplicably rewarded him with another appointment 5 emergency manager for Detroit Public Schools where he is now responsible for the education of nearly 50,000 students.\\n\"The children of Flint and Detroit are being robbed of what most of us take for granted safe drinking water and a quality education.

Work to establish the reconnection will begin immediately in a coordinated effort between the City of Flint, Genesee County and the DWSD.\\ntremendous effort by all three partners; along with the efforts of the Governor and the State Legislature; ensured that this action occurred as quickly as possible ~The money from the state to begin fixing Flint water by reconnecting to Detroit is just a start ~a down payment, said Mayor Dayne Walling: \"I am not going to stop until every drop of drinking water in Flint is 100% safe\\nDetroit water will be introduced into the Flint system throughout the evening: It is expected that the thorough replacement from Flint River water to Detroit water will happen after approximately three weeks. Residents in Flint may see discoloration as well as noticing some taste and odor issues during the transition.\\nWater provided by DWSD will contain corrosion control agents to hinder the leaching of lead from old pipes into the water; however; the City will also be adding additional corrosion control agents to further minimize the risk presented by lead pipes\\nThe contract between the City and DWSD calls for the provision of 12.5 million gallons per day (mgd) of treated water from Lake Huron at a cost of Sl.1 million per month. DWSD Director Sue McCormick noted that the talks between Flint, DWSD and the GLWA Board were very cordial: (( everyone acted in a spirt of cooperation in order to come to this agreement:> Flint will purchase water from Detroit until the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) pipeline can be completed in 2016. At that time, the KWA will become the primary water source for the City and the Flint River will remain as a backup system.\\nResidents with questions O concerns about the hydrant flushing in their area can call the Water Service Center at 810-766-7202.

Questions asked were: Was it a mistake to go to Flint River water? Answer: We draw water from the surface waters; we treat it to safe drinking water standards. At issue is lead exposure. Lead exposure must be addressed. Actions are being taken to address the issue. Did you put kids at risk? Answer: Lead exposure is a serious issue, and steps need to be taken to limit lead exposure. Why did it take so long? Answer: DEQ has been there from the beginning addressing the issue of Flint water. Recent tests justify and require the actions taken. Action steps address short-term, intermediate, and long-term lead issues to ensure public safety and confidence of the drinking water.\\nDan Wyant also spoke to the Governor about Flint funding needs.

Additionally, some households in the city could experience lead in their drinking water until all lead pipes and plumbing are replaced To best protect public health; Snyder said state and local authorities will continue to carry out steps outlined on Oct. 2 in a comprehensive action plan;, including continued testing; the use of faucet filters and providing residents with accurate information about steps to eliminate lead in water:\\nFree filters are available for current MDHHS clients at the 125 E. Union St or 4809 Clio Road MDHHS office locations.\\nFor residents who are not currently enrolled in MDHHS assistance programs, free filters are available at the Genesee County Community Action Resource Department offices at 2727 Lippincott and 601 North Saginaw in Flint. Staff will be at all four locations from 9 a.m: to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday, to distribute filters and assist residents who have questions about proper installation:\\nAt the Lippincott location only, extended hours will be offered this weekend, including until 7 p.m. on Thursday and Friday and from 10 a.m: to 2 p.m. on Saturday:\\nOther good practices for residents concerned about lead include turning on the cold water tap and running the water until it\\'s as cold as it will go. Additionally, only use cold water for cooking, drinking and especially mixing baby formula.\\nSchool test results released; more investigation planned The state today also released the first results from its lead screening program in schools and homes. Of 37 total samples taken at 13 buildings, four samples spread over three buildings exceeded the federal action level of 15 parts per billion:\\nHowever; this sampling provides only an initial screen, and the state is committing to further testing water and inspecting plumbing at these schools. Until testing is complete, schools are advised to continue using bottled water and filtration as a precaution to protect children.\\nIn addition, free testing is still available for any other Flint school, including daycares and Head Starts. Free testing is also available for any Flint resident:\\nAdditional information; including more detailed lead screening results, is available at wxmichgan9ovllntater: ###\\nDave Murray Deputy Press Secretary Executive Office of Governor Rick Snyder Murraypl@michigangev 517-335-6397, office\\nTwitter: @michigandmurray\\n<151008 Flint water release_V2.docx>\\n5'],\n",

       "  ' I summarize a few of the key points:\\nThe water system has been running at deficits for years. When the previous EFM left the City in 2004, the water system has a reserve of approximately S60 million. When Mike Brown was appointed, this had turned into a $20 million deficit due to years of not passing along to consumers the rate increases of over 10%/ hitting the system from DWSD. Slides 5 & 6 of the attached power point show this pretty dramatically: Substantial increases over the past few years are an attempt to reflect the actual costs of running the system. Another concern raised by DHS was the increase in the deposit for rental properties. This was necessary because renters paid the previous $100 deposit; then racked up water bills in excess of this amount and walked away: Of the affidavits currently out there, 82%/ are past due: Iwould also note that this is not mandatory, it is only required if a landlord is not willing to put the water bill in their name: The bottom line is that they realize it is an issue, but the General Fund doesn t have the money to run general City operations, much less subsidize water rates.\\nThe two page word document (attached) provided by the EFM gives you a good overview of what is going on They believe that a switch to KWA is part of the solution for high water rates in the City:\\nBrom'],\n",

       "  'asap\\napologize for the delay in responding more specifically to this assignment; it took some time to review our Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention program data to see if it might contribute to the understanding of the situation in Flint with their water supply: Here is what we found:\\nWe looked at lead testing results for May 2014-April 2015, which is the 12 month time frame just after Flint started drawing their water from the river (water source changed in April 2014): We compared lead testing rates and lead testing results to the same time frame for the previous 3 years, to see if there were any patterns that suggested that there were increased rates of lead poisoning after the water supply was switched: Per the attached charts \"\\nLead testing rates remained about the same from year to year (chart on the right): There was a spike in elevated blood lead tests from July-September 2014 (chart on the left; gold line)  However that pattern was not terribly different from what we saw in the previous three years, especially in 2011-2012 (we are working with our Epidemiologist to statistically verify any significant differences): We commonly see a \\'seasonal effect\\' with lead, related to people opening and closing windows more often in the summer; which disturbs old deteriorating paint on the windows, sills and sashes. Window fans frequently blow and spread the lead dust from the deteriorating paint to other parts of the room/house We suspect that the summer data spike may be related to this effect: Ifthe home water supply lines and/or river water were contributing to elevated blood lead tests, we expected that the increased rates would extend beyond the summer, but they drop quite a bit from September to October, stayed low over the winter, and are just starting to tail up again in the spring of 2015.\\nSo upon review, we don\\'t believe our data demonstrates an increase in lead poisoning rates that might be attributable to the change in water source for Flint. We recognize that lead exposure via the water is only a small piece of what may be happening for families in Flint, however; we hope the information is helpful:\\nNancy Peeler\\n',\n",

However, it was still the right position for the long term benefit of the city and its future. They of course have not been particularly helpful in finding solutions to the issues: will say that the Drain Commissioner has been a good partner and is working overtime on the problem:\\nThey can\\'t reconnect to DWSD even if they wanted to as they sold the connector line: And, especially with the new rate increases in Detroit; their citizens would be less able to pay than they already are: The water certainly has occasional less than savory aspects like color because of the apparently more corrosive aspects of the hard water coming from the river, but that has died down with the additional main filters. Taste and smell have been problems also and substantial money has been extended to work on those issues.\\nNow we have the anti everything group turning to the lead content which is a concern for everyone, but DEQ and DHHS and EPA can\\'t find evidence of a major change per Geralyn\\'s memo below. Of course, some of the Flint people respond by looking for someone to blame instead of working to reduce anxiety: We can\\'t tolerate increased lead levels in any event; but it\\'s really the city\\'s water system that needs to deal with it: We\\'re throwing as much assistance a5 possible at the lead problem as regardless of what the levels, explanations or proposed solutions, the residents and particularly the poor need help to deal with it:\\nIt seems that continuing to find funds to buy local residents home filters is really a viable option and Harvey and all are pursuing more assistance in that work: Almost all the experts\" \\'ve talked to are convinced the problem is in the old lines leading to homes and short of a massive replacement CSO type bond that wouldn\\'t resolve the issue for a couple of vears, nature (temp reductions), filters and a final connect seem to be the best courses of action: The residents are caught in a swirl of misinformation and long term distrust f local government unlikely to be resolved:\\nSent from my iPhone\\nBegin forwarded message:\\n',\n",

Rick Snyder today awarded Flint $2 million in grants for water system infrastructure improvements, part of an overall $8 million plan to help municipalities through the Financially Distressed Cities, Villages, and Townships Grant Program: Flint is among eleven municipalities receiving grants through the program The city will use the funding to detect leaks in its water lines and replace its Water Pollution Control Facility Incinerator. (( There are opportunities for state government to assist Flint city leaders as they address issues related to the city\\' s water system;\" Snyder said  \"These grants will help recovering cities improve public services and infrastructure, improving the quality of life for all residents\"\\nThe grants to Flint were announced today at the Haskell Community Center by Harvey Hollins, director of the state\\'s Office of Urban Initiatives, and Wayne Workman, the state\\'s deputy treasurer. They were joined by Dan Wyant; director of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, Flint Emergency Manager Jerry Ambrose, Mayor Dayne Walling; and state Rep. Sheldon Neeley.\\nFlint was awarded $900,000 to allow the city to hire a contractor to perform a leak detection survey of the city water lines. The city will receive a map of leak locations and an assessment of leak severity, allowing the city to prioritize leak repair: The project also covers the expense of conducting a water pipe line wall thickness condition assessment on a portion of the city\\'s pipes. The assessment will guide the city\\' s water main replacement program:\\nThe city also was awarded $1.1 million to shut down its current Water Pollution Control Facility incinerator and replace it with new facilities which will allow for the disposal of waste in landfills. The existing facilities are not up to federal Environmental Protection Agency standards. Flint Mayor Dayne Walling said he appreciates the state support:\\n\"This announcement comes at the perfect time for Flint as we continue with repairs and upgrades to our water service infrastructure that are in accordance with our new Capital Improvement Plan; Walling said. \\'This significant funding opportunity from the State will allow us to move forward with two projects that will mean long term cost savings for the City of Flint:\\nMunicipalities are eligible for the grants if they are experiencing one or more conditions indicative of \"probable financial stress, as defined by Public Act 436 of 2012, the Local Financial Stability and Choice Act.\\nUnder the grant program; funding may be used to pay for specific projects, services, or strategies that move a city, village, or township toward financial stability: There was $8 million appropriated for the program with a $2 million cap, per local unit:\\n###\\nJessica M.

       " [' <WurfelB@michigangov> wrote:\\nHey, friends. Anticipating more coverage this week on Flint, want to make sure we are all looped in and on the same page: Treasury takes calls on funding and money and the EM. DEQ takes calls on water quality. Here\\' $ what | can share about the water quality part:\\nTotal Trihalomethanes (TTHM) are a byproduct oftoo much chlorine to kill organic material in a water supply. They are among the 80 toxins water suppliers monitor. They are considered a long-term health hazard. As such, theyre sampled from water systems every quarter. Systems are required to remain below 80 parts per billion on a yearly average (four quarters): Flint exceeded the average in the course of three quarters last year.\\nWater system operators around the state periodically get a high result for TTHMs When consecutive quarters of testing remain at high levels, it s usually a sign that operators are using too much chlorine to address high levels of organic matter in their water source. This most frequently affects systems that use surface water as & source: And several municipal water systems around the state do use surface water (rivers) asa source_\\nWhen a water system exceeds this standard; the operator gets a very formally worded violation notice from DEQ that says, effectively, \"hey, your numbers are high. Alert your customers and figure cut how you\\' re going to bring your numbers back down\" \" This is not as serious asa boil water advisory situation. But; the (think decades) long-term risk of drinking water with high TTHMs is an increased risk of exposure to cancer causing agents, so itsnot a situation that the state can accept as status quo_\\nBecause TTHM is measured on an annual (quarterly) basis; it will take a couple quarters of clear results before the city s average falls below the guidelines. This means Flint will probably be issuing another public notice about TTHM in March, despite that the high samples were late last summer.\\nFlint\\' s numbers have dropped dramatically since the November testing and theyre presently in compliance with state drinking water standards.\\nThe water as it leaves the plant is clean, sanitary and safe. However, the water supply system is old, poorly maintained and many residents\\' connections are also old and poorly maintained. Thus, some residents are experiencing water that smells off or is discolored. This is from the transmission system, $ not the production system: The three tcp issues appear to be a_ Hard water interacting with cast iron pipes, causing water that looks rusty (and Iikely tastes a bit irony) b_ Water sitting too long in the pipes because of valves not working properly or limited users in some sections of the syster; Or, C Residents with old homes that have cast iron connections contributing to the hard water issue.\\nSo, how do we message this issue in light of the many variables at play?\\n1 Right now, water produced at the Flint plant is meeting state safe drinking water standards. 2 DEQ is aware that many residents have concerns about smell, color and other aesthetic qualities of their water. There are several potential causes for aesthetic water conditions. Residents with these concerns are encouraged to contact the City firstto 2 report problems They also can contact the Michigan DEQ, but the City operates the system and needs to be alerted to concerns with their system to help document problem areas and prioritize improvements. 3_ Total Trihalomethane (TTHM) is odorless and colorless. It is regarded as a long-term health concern: TTHM was included in the list of toxins screened under the Safe Drinking Water Act because of its potential for long-term potential health concerns.

Or it might smell like mothballs. Or it might fill her home with the scent of an overchlorinated swimming pool.\\nLately, Ms. Mays, who is 36 and works in marketing, has not been turning on her tap much at all. After Flint changed the source of its drinking water last spring, Ms. Mays said, she noticed a change in the water s color and odor: Then she started having zasbes, and clumps of her hair fell out: When the city issued a boil order; she stopped using the water for drinking and cooking: Now her family spends roughly $400 a month on bottled water.\\nMy cat gets bottled water; our plants get bottled water, our fish gets bottled water; said Ms. Mays, who has helped organize marches to protest the water conditions and is on a city commission seeking input on how to move forward. cIt takes four to five bottles of water to fill up a pot for spaghetti >\\nFlint officials insist that the city\\' s water is safe. They say that the issues of odor and color are separate from the question of whether the water meets federal standards, and that no link to health problems has been proved.\\n2 Photo\\nTony Palladeno Jr,, escorted from a water advisory committee meeting for outbursts, says that the water in this bottle came out of his tap in January. Credit Joshua Lott for The New York Times\\n(c\" We understand the concerns about discoloration and odors, said Gerald Ambrose, Flint\\' s state-appointed L< emergency manager. We tell everyone who complains that we would be more than happy to come out to their house and test their water. 2 )\\nMr. Ambrose\\'$ position hints at deeper issues in Flint. Though the city has not declared bankruptcy, it has been in state receivership since 2011 and has deep-seated financial problems, which Mr. Ambrose was appointed to help untangle. Add to that & plummeting population and violent crime rates that rank among the nation\\'$ worst, and the water question becomes one headache among many.\\nThe problems, almost everyone agrees, started shortly after the city, in an effort to save money, switched from the supply of treated Lake Huron water it had long purchased from Detroit and started drawing water from the Flint River; treating it locally:\\nContizue readingthe_main StQry\\nOn Monday, Flint\\' $ City Council voted to \"do all things necessary to reconnect to the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. Mr. Ambrose\\'$ response was swift. Flint water today is safe by all federal and state standards, he said in a statement Tuesday. Lc Water from Detroit is no safer than water from Flint; he said.\\n3 \"Users also pay some of the highest rates in the state because of the decreased numbers of users and the age of the system: 2)\\nsign downtown still refers to Flint as Vehicle City. Older residents recall growing up in a place that 200,000 people called home, where good-paying jobs in the General Motors factories were plentiful.

Flint has increased chemical monitoring and hired a consulting firm to suggest improvements. Credit Joshua Lott for The New York Times\\nAs Flint has shrunk, its network of water pipes built for a much larger metropolis has deteriorated. With fewer customers, water sometimes languishes in the system; becoming discolored. Moreover, water bills in Flint are far higher than those in neighboring communities. Officials say the switch away from Detroit water saves the city $12 million a year.\\nContinue reading_the_main story Continue reading_the_main story Contiue reading the_main story\\n(It\\'$ a very sore point, particularly when you have & population with a high degree of low-income folks;\\' Mr. Ambrose said. cTo me, the conversation we need to be having is, how do we lower those rates?\" Some residents say they would rather not debate the cost until they are confident that the water is safe. When fecal coliform bacteria showed up in parts of the city last summer, residents were told to boil their water before using it. Officials addressed the issue by pumping extra chlorine into the system; but in solving one problem, they created another.\\nThe high chlorine levels led to elevated levels of total trihalomethanes or T.THM_ which required another public notice in January. Residents will again receive a notice of elevated T.THM levels in the mail later this month, Mayor Dayne Walling has said. Long-term consumption of water with high T.T.H M. levels can lead to liver or kidney troubles and an increased risk of cancet, according to the Environmental Protection Agency:\\nSome here say Flint had been 0n the verge of a rebound when the water problems started. The walkable downtown area, just steps from the University of Michigan\\' $ campus here, is now home to the Flint Crepe Company and other new restaurants And perhaps most significant, the emergency manager was expected to leave office in the coming weeks, handing power back to the elected mayor and City Council.\\nPhoto\\nMelissa Mays said that after Flint changed its water source last spring, she developed rashes and clumps of her hair fell out. Credit Joshua Lott for The New York Times\\n~We continue to deal with a number of longstanding challenges with concentrated poverty and high crime and expensive, old infrastructure; said Mr. Walling, a Flint native who returned to his hometown after studying at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar: \"But we re now 30 years past the major General Motors plant closings in the 1980s, and people are ready to move forward, so the new problems with water have been a huge setback. Mr. Walling said he and his family drank city water.\\nMr. Walling and Mr. Ambrose conceded that communication should have been better when water problems emerged. But they say the city is reaching out to residents and answering questions. Officials installed a 5 T.THM monitor at the treatment plant and hired a consulting firm to suggest improvements there, and they have asked state and federal officials for help. They also note that the switch to the Flint River is not permanent: new pipeline connecting Flint to Lake Huron is expected to be completed next year.\\nMany in Flint; though, seem unconvinced. Saterra Hill, 17, a health sciences major at the University of Michigan-Flint; said she and her father purchased several gallon jugs of water each month instead of drinking tap water. Vernon White, 57, said he often bought soda to avoid the water:\\nFor many, the water issue stirs emotions.

Most notably, the installation of a Granulated Active Charcoal filter (GAC) at the Water Treatment Plant is expected to be authorized this week by Emergency Manager Jerry Ambrose_\\nThe introduction ofthe GAC to the treatment process at Flint\\' s plant will absorb or reduce the chemical precursors which will block o eliminate the formation of TTHM during the filtration process. Engineering and design are underway and installation ofthe GAC is targeted for completion by mid-July. Cost of this improvement is projected at $1.5 million and will be paid for by the proceeds from the state approved restructuring of the City\\'s Drinking Water Revolving Fund loans.\\nIn addition to the installation of the GAC, the City of Flint is undertaking a number of other improvements to the water system in the coming months, including a water leak detection monitoring; completion of the hydraulic model and subsequent targeted hydrant flushing program; and the replacement of two miles of water main pipe in a critical area ofthe city. All of these improvements scheduled to occur within the next Six months\\n~The replacement of this two mile section of pipe along Dupont Street has been identified by a water reliability study as a significant piece of infrastructure and will greatly improve the movement of water in that area of the city _ said Dept. of Public Works Director Howard Croft.  Increasing the circulation ofthe water in the system will immediately result in improvements in water aesthetics, such as discoloration and odor. The MDEQ has given its approval to the project and the process of bidding for construction will begin next week: Construction will take place during the summer ofthis year:\\nOngoing repairs and maintenance also continue to improve the health of the system. To date, about 200 water main breaks have been repaired this year. Whenever major work that may disrupt service is scheduled, the City works to notify residents in the affected area with signage and with posts to cityofflint_con Updates will include the area of work and the estimated time of completion:\\nEach main break repair stirs sediments in the line. \"Residents should know that there is a chance of discoloration Or odor any time work is being done on a main in their area, said Croft. <This is nothing to be alarmed about and it doesn\\'t mean the water is unsafe. If discoloration of water O odor occurs due to repairs, residents are reminded that running the water for a few minutes should clear the line. Anyone with water questions should call 810-787-6537.\\nThe City of Flint remains committed to addressing water related issues. Along with maintaining the safety of the water; addressing quality and affordability are top priorities The steps outlined above are indicators of the City\\' s progress in addressing the most pressing concerns surrounding water. Emergency Manager Ambrose reiterated that development of a contract with DWSD was not going to happen.\\n\"Those advocating for a return to DWSD do not want to recognize the financial realities of such a move. Not only would such a move increase the City\\'s costs by more than Slmillion per month, but the water from Detroit is no safer than Flint water, as both entities are measured by the same MDEQ standards that have been in place for years. Why anyone would want to send a million dollars a month to DWSD rather than make necessary repairs to the City\\'s own system is beyond me.\\nFurther updates on the progress being made to improve Flint \\' $ water system will released in regular updates to the media and in updates to the City\\' s website, ityofflintcom Anyone wishing to report an issue can do s0 under (c Online Services\" .

This is a situation where you pay for your mistakes and put those responsible on the chopping block\\n\"That is why we are calling for the immediate firing of the governor\\'s handpicked emergency manager for Flint;, Darnell Earley: Earley was in charge when the decision was made to switch the city to unsafe drinking water. If poisoning children wasn\\'t bad enough, after Earley failed the citizens of Flint;, the governor inexplicably rewarded him with another appointment emergency manager for Detroit Public Schools where he is now responsible for the education of nearly 50,000 students.\\n\"The children of Flint and Detroit are being robbed of what most of us take for granted S safe drinking water and a quality education. The wholesale theft of our children\\'s futures must end now: That begins with the removal from power all those that would sacrifice the future of a single child in Michigan 5 let alone thousands in order to add a few extra dollars to the bottom line.\\n##\\n2'],\n",

The people of Flint hear this admission and we demand that the State fully fix this problem they caused. While the State taking responsibility and the switch to Detroit water are steps in the right direction for Flint, actions speak louder than words. Now, the Governor and the State need to provide tens of millions of dollars to fix Flint \\'s water and infrastructure as well as to provide for the families, children and schools affected. Iwill continue to push for changes and advocate for our City until every drop of water is 100% safe. The MDEQ assured Flint that the switch was being handled safely and responsibly. We relied on the information from MDEQ, and clearly that information was wrong: My heart goes out to the children and families who are affected by this issue.\\nThis morning our local Senator Jim Ananich said the following: \"We do not know whether the misapplication of federal rules was intentional or due to negligence. That\\'s why the Legislature needs to have a robust role in any investigation, and in ensuring those responsible for Flint\\'s water crisis are held accountable. applaud Senator Ananich\\'s Statement and urge the Governor and State Officials to take the necessary steps to ensure accountability so that this never happens again to any community.\\n~END _\\n~Jason Lorenz Public Information Officer City of Flint (810) 237-2039 (Office)\\nigrenz@cityefflintcom\\n2'],\n",

       "  \"RE: Need comment ASAP\\nThese questions all make the presupposition that the state actually runs municipal drinking water systems Every municipal drinking water system is required by law to have & certified operator on staff. In Flint s case, they added outside expertise on contract as well as having a certified operator. The nuance in your question is the idea that tney don't do anything locally without being told t0 do so by the State. Not the case at all Plenty of systems around the state make adjustments to their drinking water system within guidelines: The DEQ staff offer counsel and guidance, but State s formal role is to serve as regulator; not operator:\\nFlint commissioned the report you mentioned. If they ignored the recommendations in appendix of the report they commissioned, ask them why: Our take was that Flint was to run two consecutive tests of the system to determine optimization needs. The U.S. EPA finally came out with Its finished guidance on that and distributed it nationally this week Ive enclosed it We were pleased that they acknowledged the Lead and Copper rule is worded ambiguously on continued corrosion control.

But again; this is a question best addressed by the city.\\nHey Brad,\\nJust want to make sure yoU got my voice mail: have some follow up questions based on the FOIA'd material received yesterday:\\nSpecifically: By 2013, MDEQ had a 2011 Flint report about the prospect of using Flint River water as a drinking water source: That report includes an appendix that lists phosphates, which we all now know are used for corrosion control, in the list of chemicals that would be required to treat the water. With a report in hand stating phosphates should be used, why were they not required? Based on the materials received, the 2011 report comes up briefly in 2013, when the KWA switch was contemplated, then seems to drop out of the picture: Why was a report about the viability of the Flint River water as a drinking water source not part of the 2014 conversations about whether to switch to the river or to stay connected to DWSD? A report included in the material FOIA'd said that by the end of 2012, Flint officials did not want to pursue the option of using the Flint River as a drinking water source: Why was it reintroduced?\\nNeed a response ASAP. This is for Sunday:\\nNancy\\nNancy Kaffer Columnist Detroit Free Press wwwfreep comlabetemichigan 313-222-6585 @nancykaffer; @abettermi\\n2 <image2015-11-03-155158.pdf>\\n3\"],\n",

For your background, the action plan includes:\\nTesting in Flint public schools immediately to ensure that drinking water is safe, with testing also available at no cost to any other school in Flint: Offering free water testing to Flint residents to assure their drinking water is safe: Providing free water filters to residents. Expanding health exposure testing of individual homes: Accelerating corrosion controls in the Flint drinking water system: * Accelerating water system improvements to address replacing lead service lines Expediting the completion of the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline: Expanding a Safe Drinking Water Technical Advisory Committee to ensure the best technology, practices and science are being followed by adding an expert from the Environmental Protection Agency' s Office of Research and Development to the group. * Naming Dr. Eden Wells, chief medical executive for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, as the Flint drinking water public health adviser.

       "  'December 17, 2015\\nContact: Chris De Witt 517-881-4784\\nFlint Water Advisory Task Force Initial Recommendations\\nLansing, MI--The Flint Water Advisory Task Force today released a letter recently sent to Governor Rick Snyder, and the Governor\\'s response, regarding initial recommendations to address health protection challenges with the Flint water supply. Copies of the letters are attached.\\n\"We felt it was imperative to make these initial recommendations to help address the water crisis in Flint instead of waiting until our final report is submitted, said FWATF Co- Chair Chris Kolb. \"We appreciate the prompt acceptance of our request for action by the Governor and see it as a step forward_ II\\n\"The Task Force has been holding a number of fact finding interviews with individuals and groups that have pertinent information about what happened in Flint; I FWATF Co- Chair Ken Sikkema stated. \"While the Task Force is far from done with our work, the initial review has presented a very disturbing situation that will require many actions to help those that have suffered. We saw no reason to wait until the final report to make\\n1 these initial recommendations. We also anticipate that we will made additional recommendations prior to the final report: II\\nThe FWATF letter included in part:\\n\"One primary concern we have at this point is that the current efforts appear to be taking place in the absence of a larger project coordination framework that measures results and clearly delineates responsibilities for continuing actions to protect public health. We believe the state is best positioned to facilitate this larger framework, which should address the following: 1. The need for MDHHS and MDEQ-~and, possibly, other state agencies--to set goals for actions in collaboration with local and federal agencies and organizations. 2 The need for a set of corresponding timelines for the goals. 3_ The need to establish responsibility for meeting the goals in a timely fashion and for contingency plans for the state if the goals are not being met: 4_ The need for clear, regular communication with the Flint community and stakeholder groups regarding action steps and updates. We also believe it important that a single person or entity_potentially independent of any one particular state agency and mutually agreeable to this Task Force and you_ Governor_be established to provide effective coordination of ongoing activities and reporting on the status of mitigation measures: For this, we also believe a readily understood \"dashboard II should be developed that reports on the goals, timelines and assignments. This will enable members of the Flint community, public health providers, and state agencies to know about the status of the Flint water crisis mitigation program as well as promote coordination and accountability. The Task Force is prepared to assist in the development of that dashboard_ II\\nThe full FWATF report is expected to be completed in early 2016.\\nMembers of the Task Force include:\\nMatthew Davis; M.D. M.A.P.P., is professor of pediatrics and internal medicine at the University of Michigan Health System and professor of public policy at the Gerald R. Ford School at the University of Michigan, having joined the faculty in 2000. Davis also is a professor of health management and policy at the School of Public Health: He previously served as the chief medical executive of the Michigan Department of Community Health/ Department of Health and Human Services:\\nChris Kolb is president of the Michigan Environmental Council, a statewide coalition of 70 environmental, public health and faith-based nonprofit groups. Before joining the MEC, Kolb represented Ann Arbor in the state House for six years and served six years on the Ann Arbor City Council: He has been president of the MEC for six years:\\nLawrence Reynolds, M.D:, is & pediatrician in Flint who serves as president of the Mott Children\\'s Health Center. He received his medical degree from Howard University College of Medicine and has been in practice for 36 years. He has served as president of the Genesee County Medical Society and the Michigan Chapter of the American Academy of\\n2 Pediatrics. He has been honored for his humanitarian and advocacy efforts on behalf of children from the Community Foundation of Greater Flint:\\nEric Rothstein is a national water issues consultant and principal at the Galardi Rothstein Group. He served as an independent advisor on the creation of the Great Lakes Water Authority. Rothstein also has served as Jefferson County_ Alabama\\'s rate consultant and municipal adviser for litigation related to the county\\'s bankruptcy and issuance of $1.7 billion in sewer warrants and led strategic financial planning for the City of Atlanta\\'s Department of Watershed Management: He has more than 30 years of experience in water, wastewater and stormwater utility finance and rate-making assessments.\\nKen Sikkema is a senior policy fellow at Public Sector Consultants, where he specializes in public finance, environment, and energy policy. Prior to joining the firm, Sikkema served in both the Michigan House and Senate, culminating with four years as Senate majority leader. He has also served as both an adjunct and visiting professor at Grand Valley State University.\\nThe FWATF was formed by Governor Snyder to review actions regarding the Flint water system and offer recommendations both for Flint and Michigan to protect the health and safety of state residents.\\nChris De Witt De Witt Communications P.o.

Snyder to act on water crisis in city LANSING The Michigan Legislative Black Caucus (MLBC) today joined the City of Flint, and urged Gov. Rick Snyder to issue a State of Emergency to address the continuing health concerns caused by the increased lead levels in their water. The MLBC request comes on the heels of the issuance of a State of Emergency declaration by Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, and the Flint City Council: Although Flint has ceased pulling water from the Flint River, the emergency is in response to continuing reports and studies that indicate the presence of coliform bacteria and high levels of lead in the city\\'s drinking water. Blood samples of Genesee County children taken before and after the city ended its contract with the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) and began using Flint River water showed that the number of Flint children with elevated blood- lead levels had jumped from 2.1 percent to 4 percent: Additional tests have disclosed that the blood-lead levels of children living in the poorest Flint neighborhoods have jumped from 2.5 percent to 6.3 percent: It has been scientifically proven that even low lead levels can affect many different parts of the body: Lead can especially affect a child\\'s mental development; behavior, ability to pay attention, hearing, IQ, kidneys and body growth State Rep. Sheldon Neeley (D-Flint), first vice chairman of the MLBC, is working with local, state and federal officials to find solutions and resources. A state-declared heath emergency will allow the city to access federal funding: \"Issuing a health emergency is the most responsible thing to do,\" Neeley said. \"This is a public health crisis, and our children are most at risk: We urge Gov. Snyder to issue the State of Emergency so the city of Flint can get immediate monetary relief:\\' \"Water is a basic human right;\\' state Rep: LaTanya Garrett (D-Detroit) said: \"Many of our urban communities have succumb to various water issues.

Several agencies and officials are involved can you clarify DEQ's role in the Flint water situation?\\nThe City of Flint water system is one of over 1400 Community Water Systems in Michigan regulated under the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act (1976 Public Act 399,as amended), which Incorporates requirements ofthe federal Safe Drinking Water Act. The DEQ Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance has been given authority for cversight oftheseregulations DEQ regulatory oversight is mainly conducted through inspections, review of monitoring information (this includes sample results and operations data), issuance of construction permits for water systems, and planning (reliability; emergency response; capital improvement; operation and maintenance, etc:) As both community water systems and the DEQ desire the mutual goal of safe water, the DEQ works proactively in partnership with water systems to provide compliance assistance  This also includes activities such as source water protection and infrastructure funding:\\n2 What is the DEQ's response to the mayor's request for assistance?\\nAs indicated bv phone this letter was directed to the Governor's Office and should be followed up with that office for response atthis point in time.\\n3 What on-going testing is DEQ doing with Flint water and how often?\\nThe City is required to follow all state and federal monitoring requiremerts under Act 399. This includes samiple analysis of over 90 contaminants with health based drinking water standards along with monitoring of its source; treatrent, and distribution operations Sample analysis frequency is based on the specific contamninant type, its level of detection if any; adits potertial variability.\\nIn regards to total collform and e.coli bacteria compliance ronitoring, the City Is required to aralyze atleast 100 samples each ronthly corpllance period from its distribution systern.\\nIn regards to Total Trihalomethane (TTHM} compliance monitoring  the City is required to collect quarterly sarples fromn 8 locations in its distribution system The TTHM standard is based on & Running Annual Average for each of the & locations, rather than individual sarnple results. The location and timing of these samples is based on worst case conditions in the water System to identify the highest level of long term exposure\\n4 So far, how many drinking water violations have occurred in Flint since the switch to Flint River water and what sanctions if any does the city face?\\nThe City has had the following Maximum Contarinant Level (MCL} standard violations: E.Coli Acute bacteria MCL violation, August 2014 Total Coliform bacteria MCL violation; September 2014 TTHM locational running annual average MCL violation, October-December quarter (2 of & sites}\\nThere are generally two requirements in regards to the viclations: Public Notification and corrective action Public Notice for acute health threats like the e.coli MCL must be made within 24 hours Of the violation: Public Notice for non-acute health threats such as total coliform bacteria and TTHM must be made within 30 days of the violation\\nCorrective action regarding bacteria detections generally involves taking steps to disinfect and repair the affected areas and sampling to cbtain confirmation the bacteria source is has been addressed,\\n2 The City has rernained in cornpliance with this standard for each of the morthly monitoring periods since September , including thus far in January\\nCorrective action for TTHM involves taking steps to reduce the amount of TTHM so that they are below the standard  The City is required to complete an Operational Evaluation report within 90 days Of the violation. This report includes exarination 0f treatment and distribution operatioral practices (source water quality, treatrent changes, storage tank operations, excess storage capacity, distribution system fiushing; treatmert problers that contribute t0 TTHM forration. The City proactively completed an Operational Evaluation following sample results from August 2014, and is now completing another operational evaluation further evaluated based on inforration from the Novernber monitoring  Noverber monitoring showed individual sample results now below the standard at 7 of & locations However, as noted compliance is determined based on a running annual average at each location\\n5 . What does DEQ tell Flint residents who call DEQ with concerns about discolored water?\\nCallers indicating discoloration or Other aesthetic water quality Issues are directed to contact the Flint DPW to allow the DPW staffto investigate the situation. Generally color, odor and taste are aesthetic water quality issues not related to any health based standards including total coliform bacteria, e coli bacteria, and TTHM:\\nTreated water is monitored for color at the Water Treatment Plant 35 pan ofits operation; andhas notbeen abnormal: The City Of Flint has over 500 miles of distribution piping and conditions in some isolated sections of water main piping or private premise plumbing may cause changes to aesthetic conditions such as color, taste, or odor.\\nThose are my major questions.
