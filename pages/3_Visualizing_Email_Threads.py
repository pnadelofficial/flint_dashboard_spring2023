            Caleb Pekowsky took on the difficult task of reconstructing email threads. After many attempts,
            he was able to create the structure below by using the pagination at the bottom of each page
            in the FOIA response. Each email thread began with a pagination of 1 and continued until the pagination 
            reset to 1 and the thread ended. Although helpful, this process only returned a list of images which 
            were related, so we used a Named Entity Recognition model (see *Person to Person Networks*) to split 
            the images into emails and extract relevant metadata from each.
