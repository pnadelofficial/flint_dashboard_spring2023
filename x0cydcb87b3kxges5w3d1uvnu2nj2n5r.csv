Conversely, there is a bit of positive I have taken from the situation, in terms of very practical concerns like the state of our digital infrastructure, and how much this pandemic and quarantine may have accelerated the development of platforms and methodologies for deploying goods and services virtually that may not have been prioritized or even acknowledged prior to the current situation.

We ended up being able to bring him home for his final moments, and he passed away 12 hours after getting home. We were only able to have a small graveside funeral. That was really hard because he was very well known in our community and a lot of people wanted to be there.

That was when I knew this situation was serious.  Then, everything was missing at the store, particularly toilet paper, and I just had to laugh at the absurdity of that.  But, my mother and stepfather are elderly and I told them to stay home and I'd bring them their groceries and things.  My stepfather first was irritating me because he did not want to stay home, but he finally got on board with that and I was taking things to them a few times a week.  Then, my mother fell out in the yard and broker her hip.  She was in the hospital for almost a month and we could only call her to talk to her.  It was so frustrating because she wasn't herself right after the surgery, like I would ask her to call a nurse and she said she didn't know how, and I could not be there with her to help her out.  Very, VERY frustrating.  I understood the reason for this, but it did not help my anxiety.  Her mind improved however (the nurse explained it was probably due to pain medication) and I continued taking food to my stepfather, but now, I had to cook things for him as my mother usually cooked and he just could not figure out how to make even simple things.  My mother was quarantined for running a fever but her covid test was negative and I was relieved, but then, our family had to decide on sending her to a rehab facility or bringing her home.  I wanted her to go to the facility as I know it is important she gets the most therapy possible, but my brothers and her husband wanted her home, so she is home now.  This is stressful to me as I just can't be there every day.  I live 45 miles from her and I have a child to care for, and I couldn't help her to get up anyway.  My brothers are all helping her.  They felt it was important to keep her out of these facilities with the Covid-19 virus going through them and I don't dispute that, plus it would be another place where we would not be allowed to see her.  So, this whole situation which would normally be very stressful is just amplified tremendously because of the virus.  On top of that, my husband is an essential worker (truck driver, local deliveries) so I am dealing with the fear that he could catch this virus and bring it home to me, a diabetic, or our son, an asthmatic.  Yes, this virus has contributed to much stress here for me.  I feel as if I am handling it pretty good although I admit I went through some depressive thoughts about my mother as I fear she will not walk and this will lead to her death.  She has secondary issues, like diabetes and renal failure, and they discovered her heart was enlarged.  But, I think it would not be normal not to feel low over this situation.  I do try to keep an optimistic outlook on her situation as well as our situation here at home.  My husband is doing what he can not to bring the virus home, and he seems to be taking it seriously.  My son is doing his schoolwork on the computer and seems to be okay there.  So, we'll get through this.  ",12,6,0,6

This is a little more stressful from home, but it is essentially my normal work. But now we must consider what else the last few weeks have thrown our way.

My step-son is an extremely conservative person. He has been clear that this is a hoax or a Chinese experiment. He insists that he isn't afraid and is mad at us for making him leave his job at WalMart. My wife has respiratory issues as it is, so she needs protected as much as possible.

A month or so before COVID-19 started, I lost my job (online work from home job), but I was able to find another one working from home and remaining home with my son. We were just starting to get on our feet again when the Pandemic started. When the Pandemic started, some of our bills were reduced or were put on hold until this is over (ie student loans cancelled until October, car payment was reduced, phone bill reduced, etc.). Then we were able to get our stimulus check, and that helped us pay down some of our debt. My husband is considered essential, so he was able to keep his job and everything was normal, so financially speaking, the Pandemic has helped us. This does not mean that we are happy that it has happened due to the fact that people are losing their lives because of it. 

As far as our everything life, since I am a stay at home mom working from home, our routine is almost the same. The only thing that has changed is that we have not been leaving our house to go to church or be involved in church activities. I have also stopped going to the grocery store weekly, but have instead decided to go bi-weekly, so as to cut down on our possible exposure. We have also isolated ourselves from our family, which has been hard, but I feel has been necessary. We have still been able to video chat our family which has helped keep us in contact with people and not feel as isolated.

Being a stay at home mom and never leaving the house but to get groceries has affected my mental health some. I am in introverted person and enjoy being home, so overall I have enjoyed it, but being stuck at home with a two year old for weeks on end without much of a break has been kind of hard. I decided that this was a good time to start working out and focusing on my health, which is what I have done. I have made sure that me and my son are going outside for a few hours a day to burn energy and to be outside. We are lucky to have a large yard to play in and that has helped me mentally deal with being stuck at home for weeks on end. I have been trying to keep a positive attitude and just go with the flow. Since I cannot control the situation, I might as well just go with the flow and let things go and they will. 

Our state is slowly opening back up, and we have had some contact with our family and are starting to go back to church but everything is heavily regulated. We all wear masks, we all sit six feet or more apart, and are constantly washing our hands and being mindful of the virus. Starting to get back into a more normal routine has helped mentally as well.

1) First, I've been in touch with friends more often. In our day-to-day lives we tend to exist in a logistical bubble, and the pandemic has become the external triggering excuse to connect. It's led my old college friends to set up a regular weekly hangout.
2) Second, I didn't realize how I depended on anxiety as a stressor to function. I identified myself as someone who enjoys talking and being with others, but after a few weeks at home, I realize that those are habits that I've overlaid on top of my natural introversion. In other words, in order to be productive socially and at work, I require something stressful. When I'm not anxious I don't want to do anything and feel a little lethargic and purposeless. I'd like a way to find a way to interact with others and my work that doesn't require feeling like I'm on high on stress.  ",18,4,0,14

Those have stopped and, because I thrive on live music, that has caused quite a bit of sadness.  Many musicians are performing online.  I watch when I can and always donate/tip/pay in order to help support them.  My only significant worry is that my 22-year-old daughter goes out to work at times.  I worry that she might catch COVID-19.  Hopefully, the effect would be minimal because of her age and good health.  I worry a bit that she might bring the virus home.  I am not concerned about dying but it concerns me a bit that, if I should get COVID-19 and croak, she might feel some degree of guilt.  We have discussed that possibility and I think she would be ok with it.  She now buys the groceries, which is a change, but I'm fine with it.  Because I was able to fulfill a long-time dream immediately before this all hit, I am pretty satisfied.  I took my daughter to Viet Nam (where she was adopted from) and we returned on March 1.

Because I relied completely on these suppliers for my business, when they were quarantined or locked down, my business was severely impacted, and had to be closed.

My suppliers have still not come back on line, so my business most likely will not come back, especially when considering the fact that there may be additional waves of this disease and I cannot rely on their services.

Overall though, I am grateful that I had advance warning of this epidemic, and was able to prepare.  While the bills are piling up, I am still able to pay for the necessities, and have an abundance of food and medications if this turns even worse.

I have three adult children living with me, one of whom has autism and is a very picky eater, and keeping them fed is a great worry of mine. I also worry about not being able to access healthcare. My clinic is open and has very good safety guidelines in place, but I would need to use a rideshare to get there and back and I won't take that risk right now. I am at high risk for complications due to COVID-19 due to morbid obesity, and one of my children is as well (due to severe asthma). We are being extremely careful and will self-isolate for longer than the general population. At this point, it's hard to imagine life resuming as it was before the pandemic. My children are suffering major anxiety from the situation, which increases my stress as I try to help them cope.

I also can't go out for leisure, which was especially important to me because I live in a household that is subject to a lot of tensions because of arguments about personal choices.

The future, specifically my academic future, also seems much more uncertain than it was before. I wanted to apply to schools but had to take an entry exam to do so. Many dates of that exam were cancelled and test-takers had to wait for a few weeks to receive news from the test organizers about rescheduling. In the end, the exam structure was changed and the testing calendar is set up in a way that it never has been in the recent past. Many schools may also have their classes online semi-permanently, but again, students and future students like myself have to wait to receive updates on this.

Economically, there has been a great impact on my household specifically, though this is also the case for many other people. My parents own a store in a coastal city in which the economy is dependent on summertime tourism. They haven't been able to open the store since this began, and the main income-generating period has already begun (Memorial Day weekend is one of the four big holidays of the season, and it passed already). My siblings, who I also live with, are able to work from home, luckily. My friends are also lucky in this regard.

I think we're so used to having immediate feedback, immediately updated data, knowing things on the granularity level of one day max, that when we find ourselves in this situation where the granularity has been increased to at least months, we don't really know how to deal with that mentally. So everything I say below is in the context of: we're still only in month 3-4 of this (in the US) and we expect this to be an 18-24 month-long endeavor. Therefore any feelings we have about it are really our feelings about the very start of this experience. 

I was going to be doing a lot of traveling for work this year, spending almost the whole year away from my wife and our dogs. COVID put all of that on pause, and for the past 81 days I've been living at and working from home. To be completely honest, this part has been a godsend. It has been personally fantastic to get this much time to recharge at home, because my job is very intense and demanding of your time. It's been amazing to be able to talk to my wife so much, get so much quality time with the dogs, explore some new hobbies, etc. So far, my pay has stayed the same, though that could change as soon as this week.

I tend to have a mindset of ""staying in the moment,"" and I am a bit of a ""fly by the seat of my pants"" person and worker, so all this uncertainty doesn't phase me that badly. But I do find myself not worrying, but just thinking about the future quite a bit. Will I need to change professions? Will my wife and I need to move back to the city we lived in previously?

Small amount of savings depleting every day, living with family that also is depleting that can't find work, and outlook in the future with the no distancing riots seems like the covid-19 will be an all winter thing with further economic issues.

I worry about my friends who are still in school and just graduated and how they were not able to experience the last 6 weeks of their senior year and that it's unfair school has become entirely online. Fortunately, my parents have not been affected, but they leave the house every day to go grocery shopping or to meet with friends, so I am worried they might become infected and infect me. I appreciate being able to talk to some of my friends more online through Discord and Facebook Messenger, but know that they must be upset with everything going on. I just want this to end and to be able to return to my normal life. I miss dressing up to go outside and hanging out with friends just walking around, eating, or going for a drink. I also worry about familial tensions and domestic violence increasing while people are stuck at home. My parents have definitely fought more since social distancing started and I think things will get better once people are allowed to go out more. I also am concerned more so about the rest of the country and think it's dumb that some states are reopening completely. There will just be a second wave of COVID and more people will die due to their own selfishness and need to go out and live their lives.",38,16,10,12

I decided to take a break until I saw how things were going because I am at high risk for serious illness from COVID-19 infection.

If I had realized how poorly everything would be handled, I would have made different choices than just hanging out to see what happened. I mistakenly thought we would be able to limit the spread similar to how other countries had.

So, I doubt I will return to work. I filed for Social Security retirement, which is not really enough money. My housing situation is tenuous as is my financial situation. 

I have a loved one in a nursing home in our state where more than 60% of deathas are associated with nursing homes. It has been closed to visitation since March 13th. And I hear from here that the aides working there this weekend were not even wearing masks.

I am fairly depressed now, although not as bad as when I sought help 30+ years ago for situational depression after a string of difficult events. I am rooming with a relative who is very anxious and we are arguing a lot and I find it draining. 

The pandemic has pretty much upended all my plans, including where I planned to move and my plan to work another year or two at least.

My personal life hasn't been affected too much I guess. My job is pretty much the same - I was working from home periodically before, but now I never have to go into the office for meetings, which I don't mind. I have some health conditions that are better managed having a fully flexible schedule and the ability to wear comfy (non-professional) clothes and stretch, which is more feasible at home than in an office.

I don't have to spend as much time with people (which I thoroughly enjoy). I have the opportunity to be very careful about those I do choose to virtually socialize with. There are a few friends who I've been self-isolating with, and I feel those relationships have gotten stronger while simultaneously having to deal with the shitty people in my life less frequently.

My relationship with my live-in SO has gotten stronger, paradoxically. So that's good. We communicate with each other about how we're feeling and have split up housework well. My diet has gotten better since we've reduced eating out, which is great. I have more time to cook and work on my hobbies. I'm disappointed we can't go out, see movies, go hiking (the trails are very packed here) but it is what it is. I've found other things to occupy my time.

On a personal level, I am lucky that all 3 people in my house, myself included, don't work or don't work normal jobs. This means there is less risk of not being able to pay the bills, and less risk of someone getting the virus.

I do wish that N95 masks were available though. If we had those, we could reduce our chance of getting the virus way more than wearing cloth masks and depending on others to also weak cloth masks.

As for quarantining, it's not too bad for me since I normally stay at home anyway. Not being able to date is a bit annoying though.

It sat in the back of my head and didn't really bother me. As time went on and it was clear it was going to enter the country (the USA) with force, I started getting worried, but didn't really change anything about my life. As it started affecting workplaces/grocery stores, it started ramping up my worry more. Many people at my employer have lost their job or been furloughed, which has significantly increased my worries. I'm actually making more money than ever before (I work on Mturk/Prolific when I'm ""working from home"" and my husband has been given a pay increase over his usual work due to being an essential worker) but this doesn't ease my concerns about unemployment and/or economic downturn. The federal government and my state government (OR) is not doing as good of jobs as they can be doing. Along with this stress, the protests are just fucking stupid. It's an important topic, but my god! Wait until the pandemic is over. You can be ""dead right"" and that's what these people will essentially be if they keep up all this nonsense while we're supposed to be social distancing. I'm tired of going anywhere (groceries, work, restaurants, anywhere) and seeing jackasses not wearing masks and fighting actively against it. Just like you need to work to pay your bills, just wear a damn mask. Don't put anyone else at risk. I hate it too, but I'm not a baby and don't complain about the rules. I'm glad my husband and I have spent so much quality time together, but at times the constant company is grating when we're home together for extended periods.

“The issue facing each and every one of us is how we manage and react to the stressful situation unfolding so rapidly in our lives and communities. Here we can draw on the remarkable powers of strength and cooperation that we also fortunately possess as humans. And that is what we must try to focus on to respond most effectively to this crisis as individuals, family and community members, friends and colleagues,” said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe.

WHO takes the impact of the crisis on people’s mental health very seriously and is monitoring the situation together with national authorities, while providing information and guidance to governments and the public.

At a press briefing held on 26 March, Dr Kluge, together with Dr Aiysha Malik, Technical Officer, Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, WHO Headquarters and Dr Dorit Nitzan, Acting Director of Emergencies, WHO/Europe, answered questions on mental health issues in the context of COVID-19 and offered insights on tools, techniques and interventions to address them.

“With the disruptive effects of COVID-19 – including social distancing – currently dominating our daily lives, it is important that we check on each other, call and video-chat, and are mindful of and sensitive to the unique mental health needs of those we care for. Our anxiety and fears should be acknowledged and not be ignored, but better understood and addressed by individuals, communities and governments,” Dr Hans Kluge noted.

The changes that i've felt from COVID-19 is the lack of interaction with my extended family.

When i choose to go outside to exercise i make sure i go when i know people are not going to be outside.

As such, it's been intensely stressful to watch the US federal government bungle the handling of the pandemic so badly and offer little to no decent guidance. Our president won't even put on a mask himself, and he's politicized even that very basic measure so badly that now people are refusing to wear mask in public because ""freedom"" or whatever other asinine selfish reason they trot out, which has only put people like me in further danger.

The transition to working remotely was very easy for us, as I work for technical support, so I happened to already have the equipment and the knowhow of how to set it all up right away.  Our workload increased quite a bit because we had to help people in other departments and university students to set up their various hardware and software to work and attend classes remotely, and for several months I spent workdays where I did not have even a moment's pause for the majority of the shift.

Prior to the pandemic, I moved across the country and was pursuing training in a new but related field of work in manufacturing. I was excited about the possibilities and getting paid to do classes and internships in the subject. My classes have moved online, internship placements have all been cancelled, and the stipend I was receiving was also cancelled. I search for jobs everyday now, since classes are online and I could work while learning in my spare time, but job listings in the field have all but dried up. When I do manage to land an interview, it's in a barely related field, and I have serious concerns about the safety of the workplace (interviewers and employees making no effort to wear masks, no social distancing, no hand sanitizer, no cleaning of shared equipment). It is awful to add on to the usual pre interview jitters with concerns for my safety. It's demoralizing to have to turn down job offers because the workplace is being so obviously inconsiderate and reckless, although people have pointed out to me that it's nice to have a heads-up to all these red flags, because the workplaces were probably suboptimal in other ways before Covid, anyway.

On the other hand, Covid has given me an opportunity to reconnect with a lot of friends and family members over the phone and texts. I was consumed with my move and career change and had been neglecting a lot of those relationships before, but now we have all the time in the world, so it is easy to chat and catch up on life. I've also started some new hobbies and resumed old ones that help with my mental health and really stave off boredom during all of this. Despite some arguments, I really have come closer to my partner who I live with and we have made special memories through all of this. I feel helpful to my community when I can do things like sew masks. Instead of feeling like I'm in a constant grind, each day is a new opportunity to work on something fulfilling or interesting to me. In some small ways the quarantine has given me new freedom and a chance to reflect on what's important to me and what I want to do going forward. 

I am very concerned about the future because of the way the US is handling this whole situation. I am upset because I feel that we could have avoided a lot of unnecessary death and suffering if we were just more proactive and responsible and less toxically individualistic. I think this pandemic will be drawn out to a painful degree now. I live in New England, which is doing well by all standards, but I worry if I will be able to see my family in Florida for the holidays, or if they will be able to stay healthy. I worry that New England will get too aggressive with the reopening and end up in a bad place again, or if the fall and winter will cause a resurgence.

We had decided to move back to the US after living in Sweden for 4 years. We made the decision to move back in December and bought plane tickets accordingly. We put out job applications in the state we were moving to and planned how the move back would go. We thought we'd have no problem finding jobs, housing, healthcare, etc. 

We became more and more stressed as the time to move back approached. News was circulating of canceled flights, hiring freezes, and grocery shortages. We monitored our flight carefully and debated on moving the flight closer or farther. We couldn't stay in Sweden for long as we had already told the landlord we were moving out at the end of March. 

A week before we were supposed to fly out we learned that our flight was canceled. The airline didn't alert us, we only found out because I had been checking the flight status almost hourly. We decided to book an earlier flight and rushed to get everything ready. 

We flew back to the US on the last British Airways flight before the travel restrictions tightened. We landed in the US and were met with health officials who asked us questions and took our temperatures. We arrived back with two suitcases each, no housing, no car, no jobs, and no healthcare. We quarantined for two weeks in a hotel near the airport to ensure we did not transmit the virus if we had it. When those two weeks were up, we moved in with some close family. We stayed with family for two weeks, and by the end of it had secured an apartment and a vehicle. 

We moved into the new apartment and furnished it with furniture donated by family or picked up from facebook marketplace. We have been back in the US since March 22 and still have not been able to secure jobs or get healthcare. We are fortunate enough to have savings that will keep us comfortable for a while, but we grow more anxious as time passes without income. 

We stay home as much as possible and wear face masks when we go out. We are diligent about washing hands and avoiding contact.

The time difference between the US and Sweden makes it hard to keep up with friends, and the lack of daily activity makes keeping up conversation harder. We fight with family about the importance of social distancing and wearing masks, and have become the 'conspiracy theorists' in both our families. 

The pandemic is frustrating. We are frustrated. Coming to terms with the move back to the US has been frustrating. The lack of certainty about the future is frustrating and causes anxiety. I often wish that we had stayed in Sweden because watching the pandemic response in the US is so disappointing. ",32,12,2,18

Instead of getting up at 5:30 am and rushing to get ready and get to work, I wake up on my own internal clock, getting up about 6:15 am.  I go for an hour and a half walk every morning before I sit down to start work.  I cook meals instead of eating out, I spend more time with my pets and my husband - and we've been getting along great.  I know my friends aren't out having fun without me, so I don't feel like I'm missing out.  I talk to friends and family members - my family lives out of state anyway - as often, maybe more often, than before.  The biggest downside for me is that my daughter lives in Canada, and with the borders being closed, I haven't seen her since February.  We talk multiple times a week, but I have never gone this long without seeing her and that's sad for me.  And not knowing when I'll see her again is also disheartening.

I am very worried for the ""at risk"" population. Both of my parents are over 65 and one of my sisters is immune-compromised so I cannot see them as much. I am thankful for the technology that allows me to continue communicating with them but it isn't the same as being their in person. 

I worry about the strength of the economy and what sort recovery will occur. The civil unrest has been fueled by shutting the economy down since many have nothing to do but watch netflix and sit on the couch.

The situation of having to change my plans was annoying. I already had a plans on what I would be doing for the next couple of months, which is notable considering I'm not much of a planner. So having to start from square one was exhausting, especially given the bleak employment prospects nowadays.  ",18,12,2,4

Initially I watched the development as closely as possible - it's spread across Europe and eventually here here in the states. As it became more and more evident that the US was not likely to be taking the necessary steps to curb the spread, I began to experience more and more stress. I began taking proactive measures of limiting my exposure to others. This came in the form of limiting household shopping to once per week, wearing a face covering, and socially distancing. Further, I stopped meeting with friends (in person), and I also stopped attending the gym as well as cycling with my usual group. I still exercise, I just do so on my own terms and go out of my way to avoid others. At this point in time, it is apparent that the situation is dire, and increasingly the voices of science and reason are being disregarded. My family and I have agreed that it is up to us to do what is in our best interest to protect our safety, even if it means that we are subject to great inconveniences. Do we all want haircuts? Yes! But we realize that this isn't the time. Do we want to go to the beach? Yes! But we realize that the beach will always be there and it is not in our best interest to do so. These minor inconveniences pale in comparison to the grim fate that exposure to the coronavirus could harbor. Early on in the development here - late February and into March - there was much uncertainty, and that uncertainty caused a great deal of stress and anxiety. Fortunately, my employer also realized the threat of the spread, and allowed employees to work remotely. I am very grateful for this, and such has been very helpful for my mental state. At this point, I am still working from home, and as I live in South Florida where the spread is rampant, I avoid contact with public spaces as much as possible. Perhaps one of the more benign effects of this whole situation has been my perception of time, and when I share this sensation with others I tend to get the feeling that I am not alone in this - that time is both going fast and slow at the same time. Perhaps that we are not working towards a perceivable endgame plays a role in this? Who knows.. But for now, at least, I am buckled up for the long haul.",16,6,0,10

Luckily my family is seeming to take the virus seriously and they are all protecting themselves by wearing masks, adhering to social distancing, and washing their hands more.  Personally, I haven't really been too affected. Before Covid-19 came to the US, I barely went out of my apartment except for to go to the grocery store and doctor visits. This is still pretty much the same, however, I have tried to stock up on grocery items a lot more so that I didn't have to go to the store as much. I am just now running out of grocery foods, but I think that buying food in bulk is going to be a thing that I will continue to do more in the future. I thought that I was good about buying in bulk before Covid-19 but I've really seen how there are TONS of little things that I am always running out of and I never thought to just buy 1 or 2 units extra of at the store because I live in a densely populated urban area where I can walk or ride the bus and within about 30 minutes I can be able to buy almost anything that I need.
It's been disconcerting that some things were not/ are not available. I never stocked up on toilet paper because I can walk to a store within 5 minutes and buy a month's supply for $1. It was distressing whenever I would go to the store and they were out of TP. I did spend a significant amount of time researching what other people in the world do whenever they don't have TP. I was surprised to learn that something like 70% of the world's population doesn't use TP and even more so suprised that people view TP users as ""gross"" and that a soap &water approach w/a bare hand is considered superior in many parts of the world. Looking up things like this made me feel a lot more calm and in control of my own situation.
Even though the virus is continuing to infect more and more people, I feel more confident about my ability to take care of my basic needs and immediate comfort/hygiene needs than I did before Covid-19 was in my environment. I think this was/continues to be eye-opening for me and has shown me what people in other parts of the world / other times in the world, have had to go through.

Secondly, COVID and it's impact has caused the closing of virtually all entertainment venues, theaters, coffeehouses, nightclubs, etc. As an actor, poet, drag queen, and performance artist, this has lead to a near complete cancellation of all bookings I had scheduled after mid-March.

I formerly worked in a biochem research lab, so I approach the world in a veyr hands free way so hand washing and not touching public surfaces is very natural for me.  I have also noticed that by wearing a mask, I feel more protected from people in public aside from the direct health benefit of helping keep me safe from the virus.

A lot of states opened up in the last month and as a result, COVID-19 cases increased, but I don't see an appropriate reaction to that. These are the issues that cause me a lot of stress and anxiety lately. Even if I take precautions (social distancing, mask), I still worry about getting the virus, simply because I see other people not taking precautions.
I am not an American Citizen, I am a permanent resident. The immigration system also cause me a lot of stress lately because it was also impacted by COVID-19. Delays are increasing, so it will take much longer now for me to renew my permanent resident card.",22,14,0,8

I moved in with my father who lives in the same town but whom I don't always get along with and DID NOT want to live with. (Hes a hoarder, among other things). I haven't been able to find work and I mostly just play Animal Crossing, watch movies, and worry about the future. Things are finally starting to look up.

I am also fortunate in that I have been able to pack bags for and deliver food to people who have been strongly impacted by the pandemic through a local food pantry. It feels awesome to be able to positively impact people during the pandemic. Additionally, as a socially anxious introvert, it has been great to get a break from constant social interaction. I like that that social expectation has been broken down temporarily. I mostly interact now with friends, family, and coworkers because the church I attended closed temporarily. I have also felt anger at people refusing to follow CDC guidelines because it makes them uncomfortable. I think that those people (generally) are selfish and inconsiderate, and value their personal comfort over the health of those around them. I have seen this at my church (which has opened back up). I still watch services online, but none of the congregants there wore masks, even though they were freely provided. Similar situations are playing out across the country.

I will admit that this was also apart of a lack of action on my part to do whatever it took to continue research from home, but that was not the case. Fortunately, a lot has come from self-isolating, albeit not strictly self-isolating, but I was able to rekindle a love for hobbies that I lost during school. A smile naturally arises whenever I think about how I found that I love reading fiction/manga, something that I was completely unaware of during school. Also-finding ways to make money online was a result of self-isolating, as well as learning new skills like jumping rope and accomplishing fitness goals. What made me feel the most accomplished, was having a better relationship with myself and eating, as I can say that it has been nearly a month since my last disordered eating event, a streak that hasn't been that long in over a year.

The biggest change has been social though. I've been taking the social distancing very seriously. I think it's important. But I have been lonely in a deeper way than I had ever experienced before. I think being queer makes it more difficult because for about five months I hadn't seen anyone else like me except on-line.

It is hard to reconcile these positive personal feelings with the devastation that is happening across the U.S., though. The incompetence of the government at various levels has caused so much hardship and death. The anti-vaccination movement and others who are anti-science are causing a difficult situation to become so much worse, and many people are being inconsiderate of the health of others. Alongside all this, megacorporations are somehow able to profit off of high unemployment rates and increased demand in work from home and the tech sector. The situation has just thrown into relief the stratification of society -- essential workers without hazard pay are risking their lives and their family's lives because they have no other option, while tech workers are relatively unaffected. It's truly sickening to think about the continued injustices in this country. It's hard to know what to do with those feelings other than recognize them, remember them, and just be sad. ",8,4,0,4

Working from home has been a benefit for me as well; I have a lot more flexibility, am able to be comfortable throughout the day, and most of my work could be done remotely before anyway, so the fact that it has become an option has been great.

Not being able to see my family and friends has been the major negative of the pandemic. I have only seen my family members a handful of times (and very briefly) this past year.

In my personal life, COVID has allowed me to prioritize myself and my health; physically and mentally. I have been able to deepen connections with myself, my needs, my mental health, and my boundaries in order to grow as a person. I have been able to spend more time focused on improving my daily habits that help me stay healthy mentally and physically. I have been able to connect to friends and family in a more authentic way because theres a deliberate choice being made to sho I spend my time with virtually. I have been able to meet a new partner during this time, and although it was worrisome to date during a pandemic, it really allowed me to hone in on who I wanted to spend my time with and who I was as a partner without all the distractions of the material outside world. I was able to date in a way that allowed for a long period of distanced talking and getting to know each other before meeting, as well as holding off on physical connection with someone until I was sure that this was someone I could trust with my health. By taking more time to get to know my partner before we were physical or were even in a same closed room together, we had a lot of time and ability to get to know each other past the surface and built a foundation on lot of healthy communication. 

I thrived by not being expected to be social and not getting invited to events or holidays that I, in the past, would have said no to with an elaborate excuse. I was able to either, avoid all invites all together, or only be invited to things with people that I had a day to day communication with. Basically I didnt have to say no, or when I did, I had a very valid reason to which was a relief. As I dont really recharge by being around other people or really enjoy big holiday get togethers with extended family, so by not expecting any invitations I was able to plan my own holidays with the people that mean the most to me in my immediate family. 

I run my own business as a professional dog trainer, so professionally I was forced to adapt and grow because of COVID. During this year, I had to learn how to adapt my training to a remote medium while also providing the same amount of value as I do in person. I had to market my services differently, and had more clients that I have had in the past 3 years of running the business because so many people adopted puppies; we call them pandemic puppies in the training world. I was able to really hone my puppy training skills, raise my prices based on demand, and use my time more wisely to create content and build out parts of my business that I didnt have time for before when I was driving to meet clients all day. 

I truly grew leaps and bounds this year, in part because I got to listen to myself and what it feels like to say ""no"" as a full sentence. I was able to grow my business, after months of adapting, and grow as a dog trainer. I was able to recharge more in solitude, and spend my energy/time with people that lit me up, rather than doing things out of obligation. 

I feel stronger in myself than I did last year. I feel stressed about what is to come, but I know that if I handled staying alive and keeping a business alive during a pandemic that I can handle most anything that comes my way. Also its nice to have an actual president in the white house now handling COVID in a way that is helpful to the American people, that brought a lot of my stress down in November.",28,22,4,2

My last two rotations during school were cancelled due to COVID and I completed virtual modules from home. Also my graduation ceremony was cancelled. After I passed my boards and became licensed, I found that the job market was not looking to hire new people at the hospitals. I have been looking for a job since I graduated, about 10 months. I have had to find other jobs unrelated to my training to do to keep myself busy and to bring some sort of income to my household. Also, in October 2020, I got married. My bachelorette party and bridal showers were both cancelled and re-scheduled to be safer and I had a considerable amount of stress and anxiety leading up to the wedding. We were able to hold our wedding as planned with the PPE modifications and social distancing recommendations from our venue and the CDC. Luckily we did not have a single positive case from our wedding but it was a fear. In July 2020 both of my parents, myself, and my husband got COVID. We all handled it well. In November 2020 my brother and his fiance also got COVID. They too handled it well. In September 2020 my grandma died (not from COVID) while living in a skilled nursing facility. We had been unable to visit her in person since before the pandemic.

These are the negatives that were brought into my life by COVID and thinking about them makes me a little uneasy. However I really feel pretty fortunate. Many, many great things have happened in my life over the last year as well and I really think about these much more than all the negatives. Everyone's pandemic story is similar regarding issues with employment, family members, and big events. I don't feel special because of the problems I've faced. I actually feel like I have a ton to be grateful for and I am a much happier person today than I was before the pandemic. When I think about 2020 I actually tend to think about the things that made me happy. I spent a lot of time at a friend's lake house, adopted a kitten, my husband got a raise, went on vacation to a national park in Utah, went on a gulf fishing trip in Florida, had an amazing wedding, went on a honeymoon trip to Mexico, moved into the perfect apartment, and I celebrated the holidays with my family without fear of COVID since we had all already had it.

My direct friends and family haven't had to make any lifestyle changes that distance them from me, except I'm not doing a once every month or two gaming session with friends (instead we just game everyday together online).  My family is financially secure.  We happened to have a ton of toilet paper at the start of the pandemic, so we were never bothered by that shortage either.  The governor of my state took covid seriously, and it never spread much in this rural area.

The vast majority of my emotions dealing with covid were frustration with how terribly trump handled it, and how many tens of thousands (hundreds of thousands?) of deaths were 100% preventable if we just had a competent president last year.  I've been somewhat afraid of catching it, but acutely aware that I have very little risk of that actually happening due to my lifestyle.

At this point, my stress dealing with covid is fairly low.  Although I made a point to never ruminate/obsess over it in the first place, because rumination in general is terrible for you.  I'm able to get my first vaccination shot in a week or two, and with biden's goal of 200 million vaccinations in like 30-40 days from now, covid should basically be done here in a couple months.  Mutations are worrying, but at the same time, I know that the technology used to make these covid vaccines can be used to rapidly create vaccines to handle mutant variants.

I am in a long distance relationship which has been stressful in the pandemic not being able to see my partner, and my family is also very far away. Especially a few months ago, I often had dreams that I would never be able to see them again. However, I was vaccinated (fully in 02.21) which has eased a lot of my concerns over my personal health and now is shifted to those that are close to me and the prospects for the future.

I'm in self-isolation because I was exposed to a neighbor with covid (masked for about 10 minutes). Then, I experienced symptoms and I've been in bed for like a week. The good news is I've tested negative twice, so I'm not sure what the heck is going on with me? Is it really just psychosomatic, or am I seriously so unlucky that I got the flu right after seeing someone who had it? So, I've been really really irritated and tired. I'm just at a breaking point. I also can't work out and that's my number one stress reliever. (Or drink!!) 

Work wise - I'm losing my job next week. That's not Covid related. It was always supposed to end, so my economic anxiety is through the roof. However, I have a passion hobby job that I LOVE which brings in income and I've been more productive than ever. I may even be able to make that my full-time career. So it's a mixed bag. Not fun to lose my health insurance. 

I find myself more inundated with friends and family than ever. I hate saying this, but I feel really annoyed by constant texts, calls and Zooms. Good problem to have, I know. And I'm relieved to not have my full-time job. I don't like the new rules of working from home. I feel like I'm on call 24 hours a day. Yesterday I had no work until about 3PM and then I worked until 1AM. That makes me cranky. I live at work, I don't like that. I need to be able to have hours that I'm off.

It has helped with his diabetes though as we can monitor it more closely with him at home. My youngest who was suppose to be in his last year of preschool is not going to school, so I have to make sure he doesn't get behind, we do many worksheets with him each day and week to keep him sharp and ready for kindergarten when the time comes.  

I go grocery shopping less and buy more. I sometimes use curbside pick up for Sams club so I don't have to go in there since it's so busy. 

I see my other family members less. Some family is in the USA and some are in the UK. I often facetime with them. The ones in the UK are on a much more stricter lockdown then here in the USA. 

I worry about covid often, I do not want me or my kids to have it. My husband had it in December after going PA to hunt, he then had to come home and live in the basement for a week. His grandpa died from covid. 

I am ready for it to be over, I am ready for people to wake up and get vaccinated if they can. We hope to go to the UK if and when Americans are allowed there, my grandparents are older and they lost their son, my dad, in Jan 2019 to pancreatic cancer.

I took a big risk in moving to LA, making just enough money to support myself and not much more. I wasn't happy, but I was ready to work hard to get to a point where my dreams could start becoming a reality. Covid-19 dashed those plans, forcing me to move back home with my parents and begin a summer of depression. I feel like the coronavirus has made my life much worse, and I sympathize with the people that were impacted more than me. I feel anxious, restless, and hopeless as I try to build my career in an industry that can barely stay on its feet. My personal projects were put on hold indefinitely, and I'm having trouble finding the resources to make them at all. It's really frustrating as it feels like this is the only time in my life when I can really put my best foot forward and take a shot at an artistic career. I am woefully single. I was before the pandemic, and I really thought that I was going to meet somebody this year. And I'm very angry at my friends who broke the rules and started hooking up and dating guys anyway. I adopted a dog to help with the loneliness, and while I love her, I'm still lacking human companionship and that feeling of being cared for. I obsess over my mortality and the mortality of my family members, causing me to be upset a lot of the time. I have always dealt with anxiety, but this has forced it through the roof. I can no longer find affordable mental health care, and I have no wish to pay for online counseling where I can't even be with a therapist in person. I have gone untreated for anxiety and depression for over 6 months now, and it makes me feel terrible and like so much progress has been undone. My life has totally shrunk in scope to what it used to be. I used to go out with my friends almost every weekend, socialize, and make the best of my life. I can no longer do these things, and yet I go on social media and see people dancing in the streets for their new president elect.

Every day I realize how much more covid-19 has effected my life. When covid-19 first started I was living with my parents, and the tension that I had with them went from bad to worse. We basically don't talk now unless we have to. I'm sure I had a lot to do with the tension but when I ask my wife she says it's not my fault and that my mom is crazy. My wife isn't typically the type of person to placate me, so I believe her.

We wound up moving, and life seemed to somewhat normalize after two years of living with my parents. I guess as normal as it can be during covid-19. Though a couple days ago my wife said to me that I sleep later now that I live here. I couldn't figure out why initially. I wound up blaming my mother on it. I said she never got up early, so I got up earlier to enjoy the peace of the day. It wasn't until I was filling out this questionnaire that I realized I sleep in so much later now because I don't go into college anymore. 

I use to go into college every day, and now that I don't I basically have not motivation to get up. It's sad to realize how the isolation has started to effect my life. I miss going in. I spent a lot of time tutoring people in programming (that's what I am going to college for). Not because I got paid for it or anything, but because I enjoyed doing it and people always had questions for me, and I was basically always in the lab... But now that I don't go in I don't get that social interaction anymore. 

I've also noticed that my grades are starting to slip because I don't go into the labs every day. I think that I was also very motivated by talking to other people in class about the work we were doing. If I started slacking and someone mentioned a homework I basically immediately got it done. Now there's no accountability. Surprisingly I've been offered two internships this semester though. I think I'm sort of riding on the coat tails of my hard work before this all started.

And finally my grandpa died because of covid-19. He wasn't officially diagnosed but I'm nearly 100% sure that he had it. At the time there wasn't any good testing, and they said it was pneumonia... Apparently they said it was pneumonia a lot when this all started. Few months later they wound up saying that lots of people had pneumonia on their birth certificate when it was really covid-19... Not to mention he was in his 70s, a smoker, and had COPD. I don't really believe in consequences that much.

So yeah, that's been my experience with covid so far. Glad I could share it with you, random stranger who probably won't read the whole thing.",68,30,12,26

I've been unable to get a job in my field, and I'm afraid my degree, while not worthless, will not allow me to get the job I want as I may be unable to find opportunities for research and teaching since everyone is cutting budgets, and our university in particular fired all adjuncts in the department.  I'm still concerned as my wife hasn't gotten a job due to fears of covid, but fears of covid are meaningless.

I've started a new job with the state working initially at a call center to handle unemployment claims, and it was such an emotionally stressful fulltime job as not only did I work 50+ hours a week because of the volume of calls, but several people would either berate me or manipulate me with such an effective emotional story that I felt hard to make it to lunch let alone the time I could clock out for the day. Luckily, I avoided being unemployed, but even though I have received a promotion and am working remotely within the division, I have not received higher pay, a title change, or any of the financial incentives the media, specifically NPR, constantly discusses when saying that people affected by covid are receiving to get better. I would have loved to receive 600 a week or even 200 a week additionally as I made roughly what the unemployed people made, and I stilll feel bad not working in education as I want to utilize my degree. I'm currently thinking about taking on another master's in training and development, but I'm concerned about the job market and my ability to pay for a degree due to covid.

I've recently started a second job in sales which makes me afraid of getting covid since I work at a physical location and meet customers. I'm depressed I have gained weight and want to join the gym adjacent to my second job; however, I don't want to feel restrained by wearing a mask as I exercise as I can't breathe well, but I also don't want to be in an enclosed space with many people and risk getting covid.

I long for the time when we can get back to normal, and I can simply leave the country and take on a role as an instructor in an EFL role, but I'm concerned if I will be able to travel internationally and how a vaccine or even just the expenses of quarantining will play into it.

For the first six or seven months, we only left the apartment every two weeks to go to the grocery store. Then, for the next several months, we didn't leave the apartment at all due to shortages in ambulances, hospital beds, and ICU care. The air quality here suffered as a result of per-day cremation limits being lifted due to the sheer number of dead people. 

I could live with most of this, and feel very fortunate to have been able to stay safely inside and not lose my income for the year.

For months before Covid, I had been enrolled in a training course which was to prepare me to take on the new position of a Certified Credit Union Investment Professional, which would have brought a substantial raise, a new location, and possibly even a new city. Although I was not part of the layoffs done by AA that year, the new policies they put in place essentially ensured I would be unable to remain employed there. The months of training I had completed - worthless because AA no longer agreed to pay the $5000 it was going to cost for me to fly to Chicago to take the exam, plus numerous licensing fees. Additionally, I had been approved for a raise about a month before things started shutting down, but I never saw a penny of it because they put a ""pay and transfer"" freeze on the entire company... this included ALL overtime. This was the tipping point for me. I worked, on average, 55 hours per week, with any time over 40 hours being worth 1.5x my pay. This totaled up to be well over $1000 per month I was no longer receiving, but still obligated to pay all my bills and such. I stuck with AA for as long as i possibly could before I finally had to step down from my position in order to basically do Instacart and Postmates (which pays more than my prior job after pandemic restrictions were implemented.)

I worry about my students that cannot be vaccinated because they are too young, or that their parents simply do not want them to become vaccinated. 

There are a lot of things that have changed and I feel that people are either on one side or the other. People's individual beliefs on the vaccine has our community and country split and I feel its only getting worse.",8,6,0,2

COVID-19 happening when it did may of effected it since It was a grocery store I was hired to and they needed a lot of help especially at the start of the pandemic. 

It was disheartening to see, early on, Like in March up till August, people not taking it seriously and not wearing masks or wearing them incorrectly. As a QA, I was pretty much the janitor. I felt it would only be right to take safety precautions since I have to clean the whole store. But it would of been nice if other people followed my example without the government having to tell them to at least put a mask on.

It was more worrying working through the pandemic last year for sure. More worried about how people aren't socially distancing, wearing masks, how they're coughing, etc. I was kind of worried about getting sick but less so as time went on. I was more worried for my parents, who live out of state since they're older and more at risk.

As of now, since some restrictions have been lifted and vaccines have been made available for months, I do feel safer now. Most people aren't wearing masks anymore. Seems to be getting back to normal. But I still have some hesitation because of vague things I've heard about. How there is a new strain and masks are something that should be worn indoors again?

COVID-19 has also forced me to learn how to spend time alone. I used to hate being alone with my thoughts and stress. I had no choice but to become better with it. I picked up a lot of new hobbies-- I am learning to speak Spanish, and I am learning code and working to change careers into web development. I adopted a cat during COVID and that has been great.

I feel the differences between people have become increasing points of hostility, instead of being embraced. The world feels like a very tense place now, and I feel the tension heavily. I was already someone who kept a small circle of friends and family, and mostly did not go out or attend gatherings. 

The transition at first did not feel like much of a difference, but I am also someone who makes it a habit to travel, at least one or two major trips in a year. Lacking that ability to change the scenery when I wanted to and experience a new setting was very detrimental to my mental and emotional well being, more so than I expected. Not being able to travel to see distant family at certain holidays also hurt me deeply. 

Even more so, I now feel the animosity and stress from local people in my state (Florida) who do not believe in Covid-19 or do not believe they should have to wear a mask. When I do go out to the grocery store, I come across people with no mask or desire to follow any type of protocol, that treat anyone wearing a mask with hostility and disgust. It feels like they are looking to argue or have a disagreement. It's a new layer of stress that has been stretched over top of everything else.

I was worried about the virus in general, though, as my partner is very at risk should he contract it. However that fear could only go on so long before fading, and by now I'm much less concerned, since we always follow guidelines; masks, hand washing, sanitizing of objects. 
It's also been slightly stressful being forcibly cooped up. A lot of our out of the house hobbies were closed down for 6+ months, which sucked and still sucks, and has made it difficult when I have the sudden realization of, ""I NEED to leave the house.""

That has been trying, but I'm glad they are able to be back at school in person despite having to quarantine every now and then.

Aside from those things, the other stressful part is just not being able to go have fun. We really enjoyed going to concerts but who knows when and if we will ever be able to do that again. It feels like it's been so long since we've all lived a normal life that I worry that things won't ever go back to being the way they used to be.

I was a work-from-home person before Covid. And I used to have the house to myself to get all of my work done during the day and a vibrant social life in the evenings filled with live music and artsy friends. But since Covid I have been stuck in a house with another person who now also works from home and is here 24/7. This person does not understand boundaries and for them working from home means a non-stop watercooler. So they constantly interrupt me, talk to me, or are just generally loud. My work is creative and quiet and it's near impossible to get it done. So my work is suffering a lot and my income is down a lot because of this. Which stresses me out.

I miss my social life. I miss my friends. I miss being around people who understand me and what I do for a living. I miss live music. The absence of these things seemed like not a big deal at first. But now it's been over a year and I feel like I'm ready to burst out of my skin.

I am getting my second dose of vaccine soon so that I can go back out into the world. I live near Chicago. There are a lot of people here and I know a lot of people who are refusing the vaccines. I am very worried that even with the vaccine we may still be in a situation where too many people are opting out of getting one and we will end up with another situation before 2021 is over. I'm really tired of being isolated.

I miss travel too. I miss the people I know on the other side of the country. I miss everything. I think when the world opens back up I will be much more engaged. I think I took the world for granted and I never want to live that way again. Not after this experience. As the world opens back up I want to remember to *really* live in it because now I understand how quickly this whole thing can disappear.

Covid is a wake up call.

This experience, in another sense, has also been liberating and good. Since I've been stuck inside my house most of the time I have found new things to keep me entertained. I have audited quite a few online classes. I set up a keyboard and started auditing a music class. It's been over 6 months and I can kind of play this thing now. So Covid may have stolen live music...but I decided to learn to make music for myself. I suck, but it's fun. I also bought and easel, canvases, and paints. I hadn't painted for years...that's been a real pleasure.

And since I can't go to my favorite restaurants, I bought an instant pot and learned how to make my favorite dishes I usually get in restaurants. Chicken biryani and Korean kimchi stew and really really good carnitas for taco night. I'd never have explored making all these cuisines from around the world if I wasn't trapped inside.

So Covid has allowed me to become much more creative and hands-on with bringing the things I miss most about the world right into my day-to-day activities. In that way it's a blessing.

This is probably a longer response than you were asking for, but this text box is big and it feels good to fill it and talk about all of this.

I hope your research goes well.

As a result, I'm a bit more compulsive when it comes to washing my hands when I touch something and am more aware of when I do something that could result in me picking up covid.",16,16,0,0

My fiance continued to work through the entire pandemic which caused me a huge deal of stress because, at the time, we had no idea how it affected pregnant woman and children. I was closed off from all other family and didn't see them for months. I didn't go to the grocery store, out to eat, or really leave the house at all. I felt very alone, depressed, and stir crazy.

My delivery for my son was not the best. I feared that my fiance would become ill and I would have to deliver my baby alone, or that I would test positive during delivery and have to social distance from my newborn. He was not allowed into some of my appointments. It was a very lonely, and scary experience and not how I pictured it at all. 

My daughter missed seeing her friends and family quite a bit, and it was very hard trying to explain to a 2 year old why we couldn't see anyone or leave the house. She wanted to go to the park, but it was closed. She wanted to go to the store, but we didn't want to expose her.

Once my work reopened it was hard to get back into a routine. I gained a lot of weight because I was not able to be as active as I once was due to COVID. It has been a struggle for my family and I to get our finances back on track. Due to childcare I am out of work right now and my fiance is working crazy hours to make ends meet. 

COVID has caused a lot of turmoil in my life, and I hope that things will go back to the way they were soon, but I am losing hope.",66,28,14,24

We have been absolutely excellent about social distancing, mask wearing, and generally doing our part to 'stop the spread' and it has been unbelievably isolating.

My only family are my two parents (both over 65) who I'm incredibly close with. They are both essential workers with preexisting conditions. Both of my parents had coworkers (who they work with directly) pass away from the virus. In the first 6 months of the pandemic we went months without seeing each other, and any time we did each other there was an elephant in the room that any reunion could be our last as a trio. I would weep on the way home from visiting with worry that I had just had my last meal with them. 
I still have not found work and have spent nearly every day in our new city going on long walks, farting around on the internet, speaking with friends on the phone, and running small errands. This time to decompress, reconnect with friends, and reflect has made me realize how much of my life has been spent working for other people and not for myself.

 At the beginning of the epidemic there were issues getting a few things from the grocery store, even some food stuffs were hard to get at the very beginning.  Of course toilet paper and paper towels were hard to get (now I understand why it was on the memory inventory) but I have largely forgotten about that.  The period of time where things were difficult to get was relatively brief in the grand scheme of Covid-19.

When restrictions not to go out were first put into place it did not really impact me. I was not a social butterfly and I did not go out much anyway.  The only thing I started to miss was the release of new movies, but they have started to return to streaming services.  

The only health risk I was really worried about was giving the disease to my grandmother. Pretty much everyone else in my life is healthy, and I was not too worried about them getting sick.

I worked as a nurse supervisor/charge nurse on an inpatient trauma unit for 5 years prior to covid.  Once COVID hit, life for healthcare changed and challenges started in ways we did not know was possible.  We essentially opened new units for COVID patients in the hospital, taking staff from other inpatient areas and stretching our healthcare staff so thin.  It was very challenging emotionally and mentally for me and my coworkers and the response from our management and state officials were ""thank frontline workers"", but a 'thank you' can only go so far, we needed actual, tangible support. I got pregnant and had a baby in April 2021.  At that time, with all that had happened the past year and being pregnant and working in a pandemic, my husband and I decided that I should stay home and raise our son.  It was a difficult decision as I often found my worth and purpose in the career I made for myself.  I still work casual (two shifts per month) at the hospital because of the nursing crisis and to keep up my license, but stepping away from that job and being a full-time mom is the best decision I have made for my mental health and family.

Every once in a while you'll hear about some new virus that never has any affect on the greater community like ebola, so I didn't even think that it would get to the US. Then in early 2020 I was pretty anxious because of the cases showing up in the US more specifically Seattle which scared me a bit since that was only about 5 hours from me. Then it moved down more and more and then it was across the freeway from me and moved into my town. In March they started the lockdowns but I didn't lose my job immediately. I lost my job about 2 months after but they brought me back after some of the lockdown protocols eased up a bit. Then I was going to move but couldn't find a place and had to stay with my parents for a month. I got a new place and got a new job at a restaurant and brewery and then the new covid restrictions made me permanently lose that job and I couldn't afford my apartment or get a new job. I was pretty lucky to get even that job. I lost my job and then I had to get rid of my lease agreement from my apartment and in the meantime moved back in with my parents. I got rid of my apartment and I'm still living with my parents with a job. I'm just saving for a new place and my parents don't charge me rent.

When we went into quasi-lockdown, I started drinking with the sole intention of blacking out, and that continued until a few months ago when my living situation changed. I've gained a lot of weight and I can't bring myself to go anywhere because I feel ashamed and I do not want the world to see me. I essentially lost a year of my life, and coming to terms with that is a difficult process. And I just don't see the point of talking about these difficulties with my loved ones, because I know there is nothing anyone can do help, and I don't see the utility in bothering other people with unsolvable issues.",58,16,16,26

We had just started getting settled and making new friends, and my partner had also gotten a new job right before things got bad with the pandemic. 

We are fairly progressive and live in a city that is fairly progressive (Austin, Texas) but we are also surrounded by people that are very conservative and have had a hard time with setting boundaries with certain friends and family members about what we were comfortable with during the pandemic and specifically pre-vaccination. 

Last June, I quit my job due to negligence regarding COVID-19 in the workplace. I was working for a family-owned business and was unable to receive ANY unemployment when the city shut down. My boss was still running the business during the shutdown and offered to let me come back as the only employee because he knew I wasn't able to receive unemployment. When I went back to help, I was working the job of 5 different people and set multiple boundaries explaining that I was comfortable working in the back and wearing a mask around him and his wife (the only other people in the store) as long as he didn't allow anyone else in the store and didn't make me interact with anyone in person. After the first week, all these boundaries were crossed and I didn't feel that I could speak up because I needed the job and the money. Once my coworkers came back to work and the city had reopened, there were again NO boundaries or safety measures put in place regarding masks or social distancing, so I quit for my mental and physical health leaving my partner and I to rely on only one stream of income in a city that is only getting more expensive. 

Aside from our career battles, my partner also has two parents that are in at-risk categories: a mom with a pre-existing lung condition and an obese father in his 60s. For the first time in our 5-year relationship, we weren't able to visit his family for well over a year. It was extremely hard and certainly took a toll on our relationship. 

I still consider us some of the luckiest people to come out of the pandemic because we were still privileged to have money for shelter, food, and health care, and we still had each other.

However, I've been very lucky that he's been taking it seriously. He has been very concerned for my safety, and that's usually the opposite of his concerns for my safety. So that has been very helpful. I'm feeling very lucky in that regard because this would be far worse if it didn't turn out this way. 

On the other hand, my dad and stepmom think it is all ridiculous. or, as my dad keeps saying ""complete B.S."" They've gone to several restaurants. They are both refusing to wear masks and say they are ""B.S."" as well. 

When I told them that our stores where I am were about 85 percent cleaned out when Covid first happened, they laughed and said ""Oh well, that's life."" We had trouble finding toilet paper, hand sanitizer (still haven't found any of that), could not find disinfectant spray (we found 1 can a month ago), etc. Friends tell me their children, other friends or even their parents sent them a box with these items.

I asked my dad and stepmom if they needed me to mail them anything, and my dad said ""Are you kidding me? That's stupid."" When I called and offered a 2nd time, he told me to ""stop being silly."" It's not like I was freaking out when I said it. I said it calmly. They didn't offer to send anything to me, and I didn't ask because I didn't need to be told it was stupid, silly or B.S.""  I already knew how they would be. 

IN the meantime, they were going to public swimming pools, hanging out with friends, going shopping, etc.  They both couldn't stand that they couldn't get haircuts, so they paid their hair dressers to come to their house. 

ALL of that, has stressed me out a lot. To know that people you love think it's all a joke, and don't really care if you are worried about them and don't want to lose them. 

Over time, I've learned that there's nothing I can do about what they're doing. I've tried to takl to them about it, and they weren't happy about that. So, accepting it is my only choice. 

On the other hand, my mother is in an a memory care unit in another state. Due to the fact that she had advanced dementia (and she stresses horifically if she's in surroundings she doesn't recognize and advances further into dementia when that happens), I worried about whether I should take her out of the home. Then, my city closed and hers did. The home banned all outside visitors, including family, outside mail/gifts, etc. I worried about whether they would take good care of her.  Then, the home called me and said that Covid had made it into their building. They only had enough tests to do the 15 people who are near the resident who got Covid. My mom was one of those 15. 

Luckily, my mom does not have it. The other resident who had it had only a slight fever, cough and nothing else. The home has doubled down even more on trying to keep it out of the home. They feel it was an employee who was asymptomatic. 

At this point, with decreased hours, I no longer even have the money to go get her and bring her back here. 

Our governor is in some sort of race to open things back up. People are flocking to water holes, parks, bars/clubs and more...yet our infection rate and death rate continues to climb and it's mentioned in the media (about our state's rates climbing).

My hair dresser never stopped going out. She went out on the sly, posted photos of herself partying with friends (up close) with no masks, etc. So, it made me realize you can't trust others...along with everyone else. 

I was incredibly anxious when this all began, but in the last month, coming to accept that I can't control all the crazy going on out there. I just need to put my head down, work hard to make extra money online to pay my bills, buy food (and maybe to afford to go get my mom). And in doing so, I'm far less stressed. 
Sadly, I realized I also don't trust much of what's going on outside my house anymore. People are a mess. I just need to focus on myself and what happens in my house, and that will get me through this...even if we stay stuck this way.

I started looking for work after Christmas when the pandemic was just hitting the world stage. The jobs I was looking into were in the administrative area. Not so long after, all the companies stop hiring and began to work from home. I'm still looking for work, but am only applying for remote positions that also train remotely. 

A few years ago my mother died from the regular flu. She was immune-compromised. But, it did place some fear in my heart for my elderly father (60+ yrs old who has high blood pressure). I was my mother's full-time caregiver before she passed. Afterwards, I stayed living with my father to take care of him while I finally finished my degree.  I feel like I can't apply for positions that require me to work on location because I don't want to catch it and accidentally pass it to him.  I only have a couple hundred dollars left. Since I didn't file taxes last year because I didn't make enough money, I did not qualify for the $1,200 stimulus check.  

I'm desperate for work and money. But I love my father more and my heart can't handle losing another parent so close to each other. So now I'm stuck between not knowing how we are going to pay for rent, bills, food, and dying from a virus.  Whenever I feel like applying for on location work, I suddenly see my father dying completely alone because they won't let me see him because of the virus.  And I just can't do it.

I was frustrated with my job and bosses since my division is like the black sheep of the company-no one is on the same page.  Some people work really hard and some have a very easy caseload- caseloads are not fair.  Now that I can work from home, I'm doing less work- just what I need to do.  I have ADHD so I can get most of my work done quickly.  My boyfriend also works with me and has been staying at my house with my 2 kids- we are inseparable.

They hate doing chores, picking up after themselves, won't pay towards bills, expect me to cook and clean for them.  I'm very mellow and avoid confrontation so I keep to myself.

Right as the pandemic was starting to become a full blown crisis on March 17th 2020. That was the day I got engaged to my beautiful bride. We pretty much started living together that day after my surgery on my back. Work was cancelled for the foreseeable future so I was content to stay with my then fiancee instead of going back to my bachelor pad since we couldn't do anything if I was there anyway.

After work shut down in person but we were still required to work virtually I could do that from her place so it worked out perfectly. We set a wedding date for October but it just kept getting too big and so expensive and then people weren't going to be able to come because the coronavirus wasn't going to go away as we had hoped before. So we pushed up our wedding to July and were married and it has been spectacular ever since.

My wife and I will celebrate 2 months of wedded bliss this coming weekend and I never knew I could be so happy.

We were allowed to go out and mingle but I was paranoid I would contract COVID. This led to me staying at home, even when all my friends were going out. This became worse when I moved back to the US. Right now, I refuse to even go out due to the state of COVID in the US. The alarming rates of infection, coupled with my asthmatic symptoms led to me self-isolate, leaving only to purchase groceries or go on walks. This has made me very lethargic and jittery. It feels like I have been trapped in a prison. Furthermore, doing school online has only exacerbated the issue. It really feels like I am Rapunzel, trapped in a tower, but with no prince to save me. I really hope the rates of COVID goes down or a vaccine is out shortly. For I know I have to be forced this lifestyle, I am unsure how much longer I can go without losing my sanity.",60,22,12,26

The only change to my work environment is that we now have to wear a mask when we are away from our desks in public areas.

I'm also seeing people I love go through serious economic consequences, so this is a worry for me because I worry for their well being down the road.

We have a lot of ""freedom fighters"" who are convinced that their rights are being trampled on, and they have been very resistant to medical advice or even to being decent members of the community. This had made me afraid to send my children to school. We are not doing all that well cooped up at home most of the time, but it's better than getting sick. It's also better than contributing to the spread that can make other people sick.

I have been working remote since the start of everything. I was forced to move out of my parents due to the remote work as my parents do not have wifi at home. Work forced us to go on furlough for a couple weeks, but outside of that there were no pay reductions or lay offs in corporate. One thing that I am a little upset by is our yearly merit increases keep moving back. Having to move out really put a damper in my plans for paying my loans and debt off. 

My hobbies weren't really impacted. Volleyball shut down for a couple months, however, I have decided to take a back seat with playing due to the pandemic. I have been able to continue going to the barn. One thing I miss is seeing people. I never go to see my parents anymore and my only interaction with people is visiting my boyfriend.",12,2,6,4

I believe I did become somewhat depressed, and I gained a lot of weight, about 30 pounds. I am now trying to get my life back into what it was health-wise, which is really difficult.

Once I returned home, I started back at work and realized that the amount of customers were dwindling. I work as a server at a restaurant aimed at tourists (high traffic) where majority of the tourist are from Asia. As time went on my hours were cut due to the lack of and ban of customers from China and other regions. Eventually we went into lockdown and businesses that were deemed non-essential were not allowed to operate, putting me out of work and in a furloughed state in March. Since then I've been unemployed and my restaurant did not renew the lease. I loved my job and it really made me sad that I could no longer work with great co-workers and have the same experience anymore. I live with my grandmother so I am very careful and try to avoid going out at all. It is very stressful and I feel that I am not achieving much because all I'm doing is staying home.

I didn’t go to the hospital though. My brother and I both contracted this virus. We were drinking pine needle tea to help open up the airways to the lungs but it seemed to do little. My brother did some research and found out the raw unfiltered honey can resolve this. We sought out this honey a gave it a try in high hopes that this would take away the effects of the coronavirus. There was immediate results. It felt like a huge pressure was lifted off my chest. Soon after I was feeling better there was another problem. My heart. Because of the shortness of breathe for a prolonged period of time, this caused my heart to go on overdrive and began to have a bad reaction after eating certain foods. For example, salty, heavy breaded, greasy anything tasty really. The strange thing is my brother went to the hospital to see what the problem was. After he came back they really didn’t have much of an idea of what the problem was. He just got some blood pressure meds. We looked again into any natural products that might help the heart and found a really great product. The product was called motherwort. As soon as I took it I felt immediately relaxed.

She worked-from-home for only two weeks, and my usual classes went to an online format for one month. Now, she works on-site every day and I attend classes in-person at my school's physical campus. 

Initially, the thought of staying online in my classes and being unable to leave my house made me really nervous and angry. I'm no longer angry, although I'm still a little bit nervous. Instead of being nervous about having to stay in my house, I'm now nervous about contracting the disease and having long-term ramifications to my breathing capacity, as well as nervous about passing it unknowingly to my loved ones. 

Despite me being nervous, no close friends or family members of mine have contracted COVID-19, so it hasn't caused any lasting emotion in me beyond that nervousness and the feeling of annoyance at things being closed.

For me, COVID has been a blessing in disguise. It has reinforced with greater conviction and passion the following wisdom of life I always believed in growing up:

It is truly a blessing to wake up every morning on this planet. It’s an opportunity to do something you love, something no one has ever done; essentially as I call it- gratefully lead a lifetime of purpose, passion and impact!

Health, fitness and wellness are incredibly important. I've realized it fully, only to use COVID-imposed lock down as an opportunity to sow good seeds of positive habits like Yoga Meditation and Exercise.

With the work-from-home facility and being confined indoors but not only physically because I do worry about my mental health and that of others because of the whole situation, anxiety, chaos, and panic that happens in our mental health is becoming a big concern to me when thinking about the pandemic when overlooking the physical stress.

Stress, anxiety are normal reactions when facing a pandemic as Covid-19. However,I think it is worth panicking because;

For infected people: Harmful symptoms of infection, such as fever, cough, insomnia, could directly lead to anxiety and mental breakdown. The stressful feeling of being suspected by an infection described ‘killer virus’ can create serious mental illness like depression, delirium or even suicide.

For quarantined people: These people are more likely to think negatively and maybe overwhelmed. This status might start from feeling bored, lonely because of 14 days of isolation. Being away from family, friends, and society also increase stress and complexity.

And in my own case, for those who haven't been infected: constantly keeping up with the latest and negative (or even fake) news arising on the internet or via the mass social media leads these people to get easily scared and panicked. And truly I think I'm a little bit scared if the whole pandemic does not come to an end sooner.",2,0,2,0

We had planned on selling our primary residence in April. Due to Covid, we had to adjust this timeline and actually sold it in June. 

Once we moved, I stayed at home and did not go out for I was afraid of getting Covid due to underlying health conditions. My husband did all the errands while I did all my shopping online. We joined a meal club to limit exposure in grocery stores. We have a pool so we're able to enjoy the summer. We also limited social activities keeping them outside where we socially distanced. 

As we moved into the fall, I have to admit I was dealing with Covid fatigue and started to go out of the house but still careful with always wearing my mask, washing my hands and socially distancing. I do know people who have gotten the virus but with minimal symptoms.

So far, no one in my immediate family has contracted the virus although this week our son told us his housemate with whom he shares a bathroom has contracted the virus so he is concerned about getting it too. He is going to get tested this week. Since he visited our house over Thanksgiving, I am now staying at home until we hear his results. 

We had travel plans that we were canceled in October and are planning to travel for Christmas for our annual trip to Jamaica. We are all required to provide a negative Covid test & will get these at the end of next week.

Then I will have 4 children working on devices simultaneously in my home.  Thank goodness I have been a stay at home parent for 8 years now so the transition isn’t too brutal, however it does cut into any of my free time when I usually get errands done, so this is frustrating.
My husband is also working from home which I am not used to and find honestly annoying. 
Aside from homeschool, of course masks always must be worn out of the house.  We cannot see our friends and family like we’re used to and enjoy doing. This can make us feel isolated but we do not want to get sick. 
When I go to the grocery store sometimes there are lines or shortages of items inside. This is also frustrating.
I have been lucky that we have not been sick. None of my family or friends have become seriously ill or died. In NJ I feel most people have been careful. Some teenagers have not been and are ruining it for everyone but perhaps that is a different essay.

I am a married father of 2 young kids with another baby expected in April of 2021. The main stressors related to COVID have been tied to my family and making sure they stay healthy. My wife and I are on the more cautious side of the spectrum when it comes to this virus and have taken steps to ensure we are doing everything we can to keep our family and community safe and healthy. We always wear masks when out, we social distance, we wash hands regularly, and we don't spend time at public places or with large groups of people unless absolutely necessary. 

It's been difficult to keep our distance from some friends, family, and neighbors - especially with young and active kids. A lot of planned activities and trips were canceled and we've had to creatively adjust to find new ways of keeping them active. 

It's also been difficult from a worldview perspective, particularly with people we thought we were more aligned with ideologically.

I have the hardest time understanding why people don't take the pandemic seriously. 

Why not wear a mask? Why does this have to be politicized? We were looked at as cowardly and fearful by some of our acquaintances for taking precautions and distancing ourselves, but I have a hard time of not looking at those folks and thinking they're just being idiotic and reckless.

The only little advantage about the covid 19 is that you ave enough time for your family unlike when everything was normal but i can't call that a plus because there are still lot of people who commute to work daily to provide for the family thereby putting their lives on the line for the rest.

So, lately i pay more attention to the news especially when it's covid 19 related. I literally click on almost anything ""coronavirus"" related just to keep informed.

I had to teach my kids how to stay safe from the virus and what to do, as well as what not to do in order to keep oneself safe from the virus",24,16,8,0

Prior to the start of the pandemic, I was a homebody, so being encouraged to stay home was easy. Many of my friends live in different states, so most of my interactions with them are virtual anyway. Also, I live far away from my family, so I usually only see them once or twice a year and that has not changed with the pandemic. I worked full-time at a coffee shop prior to the pandemic, while attending graduate school full-time. Once the pandemic started, my classes went online and my hours and pay were cut at work. At first, I was upset about classes moving online, but I got used to it quickly and preferred to not have to commute and interact with other people face-to-face. During the pandemic I lost my job, and now, just recently, have started a position that is work from home. I am much more excited about my current position than I was about having a position that was customer service oriented.",56,18,10,28
